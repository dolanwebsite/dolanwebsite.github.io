Hence, Michy can play internationally for the Congolese and Belgian national teams.</p><p>However, this FIFA player cleared his intention in March 2015 that he would instead represent Belgium though his Congolese heritage is vital to him. Hence, he has been regularly playing for the Red Devils till today.</p><p>The Brussels native, Michy, and his parents travel around the world today to follow on with his football career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=michy-batshuayi-father-pino-batshuayi-supported-his-sports-career></span>Michy Batshuayi Father Pino Batshuayi Supported His Sports Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Michy Batshuayi’s father, Pino had shown his love for sports, especially football, encouraging him to achieve a sports career. His parents understood his passion for the sport and enrolled him in youth clubs.</p><p>Hence without his father’s support, the striker’s current career prospects would not have been in the picture.</p><p>As a supportive father, Mr. Pino constantly travels, following his son in his matches and cheering for him on the ground. The senior Batshuayi refrains from social media and broad media questions since he only focuses on good communication with his children and family.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=michy-batshuayi-mother-viviane-leya-batshuayi-is-a></span>Michy Batshuayi Mother Viviane Leya Batshuayi Is A&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mrs. Batshuayi is better known as Viviane Leya Isaka and is one of the famous football mothers in the current scenario.</p><p>Her openness to social media, especially Instagram, has gained an impressive number of followers since her posts give a sneak peek into her celebrity son’s family life.</p><p>Viviane accompanies her husband in Michy’s matches most of the time and is also the ice breaker, connecting to other players’ families. Her Instagram posts include her meeting with the parents of other footballers, including the father of Kylian Mbappé, Wilfried Mbappé, in September 2021.</p><p>Likewise, her social media posts indicate that this football mom is quite a brand shopper and has an impressive collection of designer bags and shoes. She is mainly seen flaunting big-named brands like Chanel, Hermes Birkin, and Louis Vuitton, among many others.</p><p>Interestingly, Viviane is confirmed to own more than two Hermes Birkin bags, considered some of the world’s most expensive and valuable designer products.</p><p>From moving from Congo to Belgian for better work opportunities, these football parents, Viviane and Pinto, have seen drastic changes in their lifestyles due to their multi-millionaire footballer son.</p><h2 id=michy-batshuayi-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=michy-batshuayi-hails-from-a-family-of-five-with-two-siblings></span> Michy Batshuayi Hails From A Family of Five With Two Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michy Batshuayi has supportive parents and a big family, including his two siblings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While he rarely talks about his whole family and his relatives in public, he only does so to respect their privacy.
