By the time she had met him, she had already done hairdressing and tried computer programming. She was working as a secretary, and that is when he asked Garland to get back in hairdressing.</p><p>She did not want to be back in the same industry as they were not paying well. But she was assigned to a progressive salon which her partner knew. So she started working there and earned a fortune. Thus, after some time, she got married to her husband.</p><p>He then kept a proposal for her to shift to the new country. She thought he would call it either France or New York, but he asked her to go Austalia along with him. She did not take a moment to say yes and went along with him.</p><figure></figure><p>But later, she was pulled in for make-up by one of her photographer friends because, at the moment, the make-up- the artist was not available, and she was forced to step in. But it turned out in her favor, and she was in demand for the make-up.</p><p>As she started to get into make-up, Val thought of leaving hairdressing and Australia too. But, while moving forward with her future endeavor in make-up, she divorced her husband, sold her salon, and moved to London.</p><p>Since then, she does not seems to be in a relationship. She has never been seen with someone whom we could call her partner. But her fans would be delighted to know if she had a pair.</p><p><strong>More Article:&nbsp;</strong>Meet Deandra aka Beau Dee From Netflix Snowflake Mountain – How Rich Is The Make-Up Artist?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=glow-up-judge-val-garlands-net-worth-in-2022></span>Glow Up Judge Val Garland’s Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Val is a renowned make-up artist and a judge of a BBC reality show, Glow Up, with an estimated net worth of $1 million to $5 million.
