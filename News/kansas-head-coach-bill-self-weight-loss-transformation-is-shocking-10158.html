His transformation to a healthy lifestyle shocked many.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The most intriguing part of his weight loss transformation is that while people have been concerned about his belly fat throughout the years, it is quite prominent that the coach loses off-season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>KC Confidential</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, in 2017 reported on the issue while taking notes of several basketball fans who had noticed the coach’s visible belly fat. A KU fan revealed that Self weighed about 250 to 300 pounds in 2016, which could be a result of his unhealthy lifestyle and consumption of beer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, it could have been his diet at Salty Iguana, where he is a part owner and enjoys delicious meals most of the time.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, the report showed a possibility of Cushing’s syndrome, a condition in which excessive exposure to the stress hormone cortisol causes weight gain and other abnormalities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, this NCAA coach grabbed eyeballs in the 2018 off-season when he appeared healthier than ever. His gut had shrunk back in, and he looked more beneficial than before.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He may have gotten off his hectic lifestyle, but gaining such easy results was not easy. Hence, his quick weight gain and loss have captured the attention of many on social media who are now eager to know the truth behind the transformation.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While many suggest that it could have been surgery, others retaliate by saying the coach could pull himself to the gym and eat a healthy diet each day.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>LJ World</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;confirms that Self had abdominal surgery in the spring of 2004.
