He helped Tia Torres’s rehabilitation process by assisting and train controversial breeds of dogs. The inmate had a lot of potential in the vet field.</p><p>As Darius disappeared from the show, people wondered about his life and many of his fans were concerned of it led him to a wrong path in life.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="What Happened To Darius On Pitbulls and Parolees?">What Happened To Darius On Pitbulls and Parolees?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Where Is Darius Now?">Where Is Darius Now?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Darius’ Relationship With Tia Torres Explained">Darius’ Relationship With Tia Torres Explained</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-darius-on-pitbulls-and-parolees></span>What Happened To Darius On Pitbulls and Parolees?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Tia Torres, Darius on Pitbulls and Parolees stopped showing up after he off work release from Dixon Correctional Institute near New Orleans.</p><p>Darius even mentioned he felt grateful to work with Tia when the episode aired. He felt blessed to deal with people like Tia, who was versed in animal care. He was motivated by Tia’s work with pit bulls.</p><figure></figure><p>Moreover, Darius mentioned he had supplementary ambition for what he loved to do. In September 2017, Darius led his first step toward becoming a vet tech. Dr. K teaught him to take an X-Ray. As a result, he experienced his first X-ray at that time. He was surprised at the moment.</p><p>However, he had worked under the direction of a doctor and found out the dog did not have a tumor and was not pregnant. He had even been introduced to Dr. Dozier. Even though Darius knew little about medical treatment, he was into learning about the process.</p><p>He has inspired by the people who had a drive like him and worked in the field they loved. Dr. K introduced every section of the veteran hospital and even spent time with Jessie. At last, Darius felt better chasing his dream.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-darius-now></span>Where Is Darius Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Viewers suspect that Darius have been released from prison after he served in a work release program and worked with Tia in her hugely popular Animal Planet show Pit Bulls & Parolees.</p><p>Fans had inquired about his disappearance on&nbsp;Facebook. They shared their curiosity about whether he joined vet tech school or not. Also, they asked Villalobos Rescue Center – Life 4 Paws, Inc, if he was still with Tia and the team. Some commenters responded to the response of Tia in season 11.</p><figure></figure><p>Viewers commented he would be a vet tech as per his potential. Someone believed if he had returned to the wrong path as before, it would be a shame. Perhaps, some speculated, he had offered to pay to go to vet tech school. However, it’s all the assumptions of the people.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans hoped he would get back on track and lead his way to his passion, as he mentioned in Pitbull and Porlees season 11.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darius-relationship-with-tia-torres-explained></span>Darius’ Relationship With Tia Torres Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The founder of Villalobos Rescue Center, Tia Torres, was the one who allowed inmate Darius to be part of Pitbull and Porlees. He served on a work release program at Dixon Correctional Institute in Jackson, Louisiana. He had started working alongside Tia at the Villalobos Rescue Center.</p><p>Tia wished Darius replaced the center’s first-ever work-release care Country, Matt after he left for New York. During season 11, the show’s footage showed that she gave some points to Darius to train a pit bull.</p><figure></figure><p>As a result, Darius was finally made able to manage pit bull sit as Tia instructed. The inmate learned some valuable lessons in jail. The prison grew him to be a respectable young man.</p><p>Darius felt honored to receive the opportunity at Villalobos Rescue Center alongside Tia. He thought people needed someone who motivates them and pushes them for their ambition.</p><p>Tia felt the same about Darius and so did her fellow volunteer and previous inmate, Earl. Pit Bulls and Parolees returned with two episodes in 2017, where they featured inmate Darius in the second.</p><p>According to the report,&nbsp;Pitbulls and Parolees&nbsp;will end the show with season 19 this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRp7a2v4yfqailXaW2ta7UpaOsZZGjsW68wKumpZ2VqHq0wM6pp56cXay8s7fIp55mnp%2BnerW0xGanoqySqrmtv4yapZ1lmJq%2FpnnIrGSwoKlk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fNews%2fdarius-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-stopped-working-for-the-pitbulls-and-here-is-why-11345.html&text=Darius%20From%20Pitbulls%20and%20Parolees%20Stopped%20Working%20For%20The%20Pitbulls%20and%20Here%20Is%20Why&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fNews%2fdarius-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-stopped-working-for-the-pitbulls-and-here-is-why-11345.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fNews%2fdarius-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-stopped-working-for-the-pitbulls-and-here-is-why-11345.html&title=Darius%20From%20Pitbulls%20and%20Parolees%20Stopped%20Working%20For%20The%20Pitbulls%20and%20Here%20Is%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fNews%2fdarius-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-stopped-working-for-the-pitbulls-and-here-is-why-11345.html&title=Darius%20From%20Pitbulls%20and%20Parolees%20Stopped%20Working%20For%20The%20Pitbulls%20and%20Here%20Is%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fNews%2fdarius-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-stopped-working-for-the-pitbulls-and-here-is-why-11345.html&title=Darius%20From%20Pitbulls%20and%20Parolees%20Stopped%20Working%20For%20The%20Pitbulls%20and%20Here%20Is%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fNews%2fdarius-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-stopped-working-for-the-pitbulls-and-here-is-why-11345.html&description=Darius%20From%20Pitbulls%20and%20Parolees%20Stopped%20Working%20For%20The%20Pitbulls%20and%20Here%20Is%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/News/debbon-ayer-bio-wiki-age-height-rob-morrow-kids-career-net-worth-11341.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Debbon Ayer Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Rob Morrow, Kids, Career, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Celeb/cedric-leighton-wikipedia-learn-everything-about-military-analyst-11328.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cedric Leighton Wikipedia: Learn Everything About Military Analyst">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
