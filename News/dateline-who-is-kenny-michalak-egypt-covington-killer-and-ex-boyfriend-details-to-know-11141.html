However, Egypt’s family members claim that their connection was stormy and troubled.</p><p>Kenny had allegedly been physically abusive to Egypt in the past and manipulated and verbally abused her.</p><p>Egypt’s then ex-boyfriend Curtis even told the police that he observed Kenny lurking about Egypt’s car while parked at Curtis’ apartment complex after he and Egypt reconciled and patched things up.</p><p>This was how Kenny started to become a subject of interest. Given the history of their relationship, it was an obvious guess that Kenny might be the killer of Egypt.</p><p>Not only that, according to the sources, Egypt’s last known interaction with Kenny occurred shortly before her death, during the Belleville National Strawberry Festival.</p><p>Kenny Michalak has denied any involvement in Egypt’s assassination.</p><p>Despite being designated as a person of interest in Egypt’s investigation, authorities have yet to charge him with anything.</p><p>Tina Covington, who is Egypt Covington’s mother, is not convinced that Kenny is the murderer. While she admits that Egypt and Kenny had a tumultuous relationship, the police labeled him as a person of interest because they were under pressure to find someone to blame for the crime.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kenny-michalak-details-on-his-age-and-wikipedia-revealed></span>Kenny Michalak: Details On His Age And Wikipedia Revealed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>We do not have much information on how old Kenny Michalak was.</p><p>Judging by the looks of it, he appears to be in his early thirties.</p><p>His personal information on his childhood, whereabouts, family members are not disclosed yet.</p><p>Kenny stopped being a subject of interest after three other men were arrested.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kenny-michalak-is-he-arrested-prison></span>Kenny Michalak: Is He Arrested/ Prison?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2020, two men were arrested in connection with Egypt’s murder 2020, according to reports.</p><p>Although the names were not disclosed at first, it was in November 2020 when one of the arrested man’s names was revealed.</p><p>At first, the first murderer’s name, Timothy Eugene Moore, was released.
