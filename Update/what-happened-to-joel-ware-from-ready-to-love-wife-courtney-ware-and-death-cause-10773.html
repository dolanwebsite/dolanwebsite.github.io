Unfortunately, after the season ended, Joel has been off the radar for a while now.</p><p>Before appearing on the reality series, he has worked as an actor on Christmas Belles, NCIS: New Orleans, The Purge, and other television series.</p><p>However, he has again become the topic of discussion, when suddenly rumors of him being dead started trending all over the internet. The first piece of information that appeared on the web was through the website,&nbsp;en.memesrandom.com.</p><p>The website published an article titled Joel Ware dead and obituary, cause of death Joel Christopher Ware ready to love. However, the rumors seem completely baseless as there isn’t a single detail regarding his cause of death in the article.</p><p>Besides this website, we could not find any such news about his death on the internet. To further clarify the topic, we explored his Instagram and social media, and as it seems, his latest post was just yesterday.</p><p>Similarly, on the same post, he just commented a couple of hours ago; hence, proving the rumors to be false once and for all.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-joel-ware-wife-courtney-ware-death-cause></span>What Was Joel Ware Wife Courtney Ware Death Cause?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joel Ware’s wife Courtney Ware’s cause of death was due to lung cancer. Joel and his beautiful wife shared two children, twins.</p><p>Courtney was suffering from stage 4 lung cancer which took her away from her husband and her children at last. Upon looking at her Instagram bio, she described herself as the “God Whisperer” and “Twin Mom.”</p><p>Joel, during the show, talked about his wife, saying, “I was grieving without even realizing it”. After the death of his wife, his two children pursued him to find some companion for his lonely soul.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-joel-ware-net-worth></span>What Is Joel Ware Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joel Ware estimated net worth is $1.2 million, according to&nbsp;44bars.</p><p>However, this figure could be conflictual as Joel has not publically disclosed his assets and properties details.</p><p>However, looking at his social media, he does look to be financially sound. Besides appearing on Ready to Love, he is also an actor and model by profession.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMo6aepF2srrOxjJ%2BpqKVdp7KisNhmq6hlnKTDpnnWop2eZZOkwrPAzZ6wZq%2BRp7Jurc2dZJ2dkam1bq%2FArqqeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-joel-ware-from-ready-to-love-wife-courtney-ware-and-death-cause-10773.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Joel%20Ware%20From%20Ready%20To%20Love%3f%20Wife%20Courtney%20Ware%20and%20Death%20Cause&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-joel-ware-from-ready-to-love-wife-courtney-ware-and-death-cause-10773.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-joel-ware-from-ready-to-love-wife-courtney-ware-and-death-cause-10773.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Joel%20Ware%20From%20Ready%20To%20Love%3f%20Wife%20Courtney%20Ware%20and%20Death%20Cause" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-joel-ware-from-ready-to-love-wife-courtney-ware-and-death-cause-10773.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Joel%20Ware%20From%20Ready%20To%20Love%3f%20Wife%20Courtney%20Ware%20and%20Death%20Cause" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-joel-ware-from-ready-to-love-wife-courtney-ware-and-death-cause-10773.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Joel%20Ware%20From%20Ready%20To%20Love%3f%20Wife%20Courtney%20Ware%20and%20Death%20Cause" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-joel-ware-from-ready-to-love-wife-courtney-ware-and-death-cause-10773.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Joel%20Ware%20From%20Ready%20To%20Love%3f%20Wife%20Courtney%20Ware%20and%20Death%20Cause" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/News/where-is-kathleen-foley-aka-katy-doyle-now-joe-doyle-murder-age-and-wiki-10811.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Kathleen Foley AKA Katy Doyle Now?
