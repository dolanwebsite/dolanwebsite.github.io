He was born and raised in New Jersey of the United States of America.</p><p>There is not much information about his father’s and mother’s names. Ralph has not shared any information about their profession or whereabouts either.</p><p>Ralph is a single child and has no siblings. This meant that he had a lot of attention from his mother growing up.</p><p>Since his father was absent from his life from a young age and he does not have a good relationship with him.</p><p>We do not know where Ralph went for his high school education.</p><p>But when he completed his high school studies, he went to the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated from that university in the year 1993.</p><p>Growing up, Ralph was an extrovert and lively kid. He was always interested in make-up and hosting shows. This, later on, proved to be the pivotal part of his career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ralph-cirella-physical-appearance></span>Ralph Cirella: Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ralph, despite being in his fifties, has maintained a fit body. He does not exactly have an athletic body, but he is lean and tall. In terms of height, he is six feet tall.</p><p>He weighs about 187 lbs. We do not know his body measurements. But he has black eyes and black hair.</p><p>Ralph has many tattoos all over his body. He is very fond of inking and says that whenever he wants to express something, he likes to get a tattoo of it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ralph-cirella-personal-life></span>Ralph Cirella: Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ralph Cirella is an American citizen.

But they got separated due to some unusual reasons that have not been disclosed.</p><p>Then he started dating Sam Simon in 1995. But even Sam Simon became his ex soon enough. And the reason for the separation was never said to the media.</p><p>After the break-up, Ralph never really had any dating rumors for a long time. Maybe he took on a break or something for himself.</p><p>But then, in 2005, there was a rumor of him dating a girl.</p><p>Maybe he is bisexual and was again up for daring girls. He was dating a girl by the name of Sandra Bernhard. They soon broke up.</p><p>In 2005, he dated another girl by the name of Sara Switzer. This relationship also, likes his previous ones, did not last very long.</p><p>None of his relationships lasted very long for some reason. The reason might be that Ralph does not want to commit to anyone.</p><p>Currently, Ralph Cirella is single and focusing on himself. There is no information on whether he is interested in dating or not.</p><p>It is still not sure if Ralph is bisexual or homosexual. He always identifies himself as gay, but he has dated some girls in between.</p><p>So let’s hope the 57 Years Old star will give us more insights about his love life soon.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Sarah Williams: Husband, Wedding & Net Worth>></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ralph-cirella-career></span>Ralph Cirella: Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nobody achieves success overnight, and it takes a sheer amount of determination and hard work.</p><p>Ralph Cirella is the perfect example.
