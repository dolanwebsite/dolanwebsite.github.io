Ex-Wife Tameka Foster<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Smiley remembers his childhood as full of fun. Growing up with different family members and having a strong sense of Southern culture, he declined towards comedy.</p><p>Rickey graduated from Woodlawn High School and, for a short period, joined Tuskegee University. In 1992, he earned Bachelor’s Degree in English from Alabama State University.</p><p>The infromation on his past relationship is limited. Digging the online resources, no information came out on regard to his previous love life.</p><p>He got into the entertainment industry. He is one of the stars for ‘<strong>The Rickey Smiley Morning Show,’&nbsp;</strong>which airs on WHTA “Hot 107.9” in Atlanta.</p><p>On September 29, Tameka Foster was invited as a guest to the show. She shared her memoir on the show where she talked about he demised son.</p><p>She became emotional while talking about him. She is the ex-wife of rapper Usher Raymond. Many fans wonder why even after having a divorce, she has Raymond in her name.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-the-actors-kids-and-family></span>Meet The Actor’s Kids and Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Actor was born on August 10, 1968, in Birmingham, Alabama, USA. Broderick Dornell Smiley, aka Rickey Smiley, was brought up by his grandfather.</p><p>He lost his father at the age of just six years old. His mother couldn’t raise him alone. For sure, it must have been a problematic time Smiley had without his father.</p><p>Smiley has two boys, Malik and Brandon Smiley. There is no significant information about his wife or partner. He has also adopted eight children.</p><p>Tragically, his daughter, Aaryn, had been shot during a road rage on July 6, 2020. He sure loves to spend some time with his kids and often takes them out for boating and fishing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=learn-about-the-actor-new-girlfriend></span>Learn About The Actor New Girlfriend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Currently, he is leading a single life. There was a rumor that he was dating radio co-star Claudia Jordan. But he denied the rumor.</p><p>Instead of getting into a love life or fall for romance, he seems too much into his work. Even his social media is full of his professional life.</p><p>He stated, “If I ever get married again, it will be to somebody who can hold an intelligent conversation.” His ideal woman would read books and teach him something.</p><p>And added that she must know who represents them in Congress. Smiley is featured on the Wikipedia page. He is active on Social media platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yroJyjla56tLnIpZyyZZWteri1xZ5krZmdmriiecWoqq2domK6prHTZquhnZmneqy1w6xkmqaUYrOiucilsGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-rickey-smiley-ex-wife-tameka-foster-meet-their-kids-and-family-11815.html&text=Who%20Is%20Rickey%20Smiley%20Ex%20Wife%20Tameka%20Foster%3f%20Meet%20Their%20Kids%20and%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-rickey-smiley-ex-wife-tameka-foster-meet-their-kids-and-family-11815.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-rickey-smiley-ex-wife-tameka-foster-meet-their-kids-and-family-11815.html&title=Who%20Is%20Rickey%20Smiley%20Ex%20Wife%20Tameka%20Foster%3f%20Meet%20Their%20Kids%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-rickey-smiley-ex-wife-tameka-foster-meet-their-kids-and-family-11815.html&title=Who%20Is%20Rickey%20Smiley%20Ex%20Wife%20Tameka%20Foster%3f%20Meet%20Their%20Kids%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-rickey-smiley-ex-wife-tameka-foster-meet-their-kids-and-family-11815.html&title=Who%20Is%20Rickey%20Smiley%20Ex%20Wife%20Tameka%20Foster%3f%20Meet%20Their%20Kids%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-rickey-smiley-ex-wife-tameka-foster-meet-their-kids-and-family-11815.html&description=Who%20Is%20Rickey%20Smiley%20Ex%20Wife%20Tameka%20Foster%3f%20Meet%20Their%20Kids%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Hot%20News/why-did-kristina-ellis-leave-the-ramsey-show-11795.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Did Kristina Ellis Leave The Ramsey Show?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Hot%20News/who-is-lucas-gordon-from-notre-dame-details-to-know-about-the-left-hand-pitcher-11782.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Lucas Gordon From Notre Dame?
