The deckhand on the Bravo series rose through the ranks to become a bosun and the first officer. The native of Baltimore still enjoys spending time on yachts and charter boats, but he gave several explanations for why he decided to stop his relationship with the company.</p><p>After appearing on Below Deck for several seasons, Eddie won over the audience, but he was not without controversy. Despite having a girlfriend at home, Eddie’s infamous boatman with third stew Rocky Dakota during Below Deck season 3 is well remembered by viewers.</p><p>Eddie has since resumed working on tug boats, and as of 2017, he has been working for Moran Towing Corporation. He was a deckhand at first and is now the first mate. His 1600-ton license, which designates the size of vessels he is authorized to tow, was obtained.</p><figure></figure><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Eddie Lucas’ Net Worth Is In A Million">Eddie Lucas’ Net Worth Is In A Million</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Eddie Lucas Had A Problem With Below Deck For Paying Him Less Salary">Eddie Lucas Had A Problem With Below Deck For Paying Him Less Salary</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Eddie Lucas Assets Which Includes His New House">Eddie Lucas Assets Which Includes His New House</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eddie-lucas-net-worth-is-in-a-million></span>Eddie Lucas’ Net Worth Is In A Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With primary source of income is yachting and television reality show; Eddie Lucas has a net worth of 1 million dollars. He is a known personality and earns through his social media. He is present on Instagram as @eddielucas, where over 350k people follow him.</p><p>Lucas is a former professional basketball player from the United States who works as the production manager for Highland Construction in Fayetteville, North Carolina.</p><p>The Utah Jazz selected Lucas as the final choice of the 1999 NBA Draft. He spent three seasons playing for professional teams in Argentina, France, Russia, Israel, and Poland after not being given a spot on the team.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=eddie-lucas-had-a-problem-with-below-deck-for-paying-him-less-salary></span>Eddie Lucas Had A Problem With Below Deck For Paying Him Less Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When Eddie was not asked to return to Below Deck, many fans of the show were shocked. Viewers weren’t anticipating this from the network because he became a fan favorite and well-known face.</p><figure></figure><p>He won’t likely be asked back after publicly exposing Bravo for underpaying the Below Deck cast members. Eddie claimed that compared to other Bravo shows, the cast receives the lowest pay in an interview with The New York Post.</p><p>Eddie’s treatment of Rayna Lindsey, his co-star in the television series Below Deck, may also be why he wasn’t asked back. When she admitted that chief stew Heather Chase had called her a racial slur in front of her, he dismissed her.</p><p>The Below Deck star has complained that the cast members of his popular Bravo show are not paid properly and that he was not explicitly informed that he had not been retained for a subsequent season.</p><p>The native of Maryland also mentioned the ups and downs of working on the deck while having to film simultaneously. He added, “Someone is making money off the show, but it’s not us. We are the lowest-paid cast members on Bravo’s most-watched show, “Below Deck,” despite this.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eddie-lucas-assets-which-includes-his-new-house></span>Eddie Lucas Assets Which Includes His New House<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the posh Hampden neighborhood, Lucas made his first home purchase at the beginning of the year. He had to spend more than the $330,000 asking price to get it.&nbsp;But for the veteran of the popular Bravo show, now in its ninth season, the search for the ideal house was not all sweetness and light.</p><p>Three bedrooms and one bathroom make up Eddie’s new row house. The original deckhand from Below Deck season 1 admitted to the New York Post that the show’s stars make peanuts and that it was difficult for him to accumulate enough money to purchase a home. During the same interview, he provided pictures of the interior of his stunning new home.</p><p>Eddie grumbled about the remuneration, but Below Deck actors receive a salary, tips, and Bravo pay. In his hometown of Baltimore, Eddie wished to purchase a home. Additionally, he made care to purchase a residence close to his tugboat job in the Port of Baltimore.</p><figure></figure><p>Although it is less opulent than working on superyachts, someone has to do it.&nbsp;Eddie is still employed full-time in the Chesapeake Bay as a first officer on tugboats. He assists in bringing shipping vessels into and out of the port while working two weeks on and two weeks off the boat. He can travel swiftly home if necessary because his new residence is only 25 minutes from his place of employment.</p><p>On top of that, Eddie receives sponsorship arrangements to advertise goods to his 345,000 Instagram followers. Recently, he advertised Dockwa, a travel app, and Tabasco spicy sauce.</p><p>When Eddie wasn’t working on superyachts alongside Captain Lee for the past ten years, he worked on tugboats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHquwcKhZKKrXZqxpbXEZqOum5Goeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqquoxrZ2tqXZ22tHnCmqmenaJisqK%2BzaKloGWZqHqquc%2BrnKyrmauycA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fhow-much-is-eddie-lucas-net-worth-his-career-earning-is-impressive-12640.html&text=How%20Much%20Is%20Eddie%20Lucas%20Net%20Worth%3f%20His%20Career%20Earning%20Is%20Impressive&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fhow-much-is-eddie-lucas-net-worth-his-career-earning-is-impressive-12640.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fhow-much-is-eddie-lucas-net-worth-his-career-earning-is-impressive-12640.html&title=How%20Much%20Is%20Eddie%20Lucas%20Net%20Worth%3f%20His%20Career%20Earning%20Is%20Impressive" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fhow-much-is-eddie-lucas-net-worth-his-career-earning-is-impressive-12640.html&title=How%20Much%20Is%20Eddie%20Lucas%20Net%20Worth%3f%20His%20Career%20Earning%20Is%20Impressive" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fhow-much-is-eddie-lucas-net-worth-his-career-earning-is-impressive-12640.html&title=How%20Much%20Is%20Eddie%20Lucas%20Net%20Worth%3f%20His%20Career%20Earning%20Is%20Impressive" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fhow-much-is-eddie-lucas-net-worth-his-career-earning-is-impressive-12640.html&description=How%20Much%20Is%20Eddie%20Lucas%20Net%20Worth%3f%20His%20Career%20Earning%20Is%20Impressive" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/News/how-much-money-does-brendan-shanahan-make-latest-brendan-shanahan-net-worth-income-salary-12634.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Brendan Shanahan Make?
