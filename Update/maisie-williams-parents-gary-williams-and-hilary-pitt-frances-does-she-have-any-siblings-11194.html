She was born Margaret Constance Williams.</p><p>Maisie’s parents split up when she was just four months old.</p><p>She was raised in the Somerset village of Clutton by her mother, who quit her work as a course administrator at a university to pursue Maisie’s acting career.</p><p>Since she was a small child, Margaret has gone by the moniker “Maisie,” which originated with her favorite cartoon character from the British comic strip The Perishers. Maisie attended Norton Hill School and Clutton Primary School for her education.</p><p>However, her upbringing was not always sunshine and rainbows. She recently opened up about her upbringing with her dad and explained that she had a traumatic relationship with her biological dad which consumed most of her childhood.</p><p>During a podcast with Stephen Bartlett on the Diary of A CEO podcast, Maise talked about her traumatic experience with her dad.</p><p>She explained that her mother had to escape from her dad when she was just four months old. Her parents divorced and Maise always had a traumatic experience with her biological dad growing up.</p><p>Due to her shaky relationship with her dad, she always had trouble sleeping at night. She explained that the things happening to her back then, she did not realize were so impactful that it is still haunting her today. She was too young to differentiate between what is right and wrong and looking back at it now, she shudders at the thought.</p><p>However, she is very close to her mother and her stepfather. She was raised by her mother for most of her life, and she adores her mother. Even with a traumatic childhood, Maisie feels like her acting career has helped her make amends for most of her past experiences.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-maisie-williams-siblings></span>Who Are Maisie Williams Siblings?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Maisie is the youngest of four siblings in her family. She has two older brothers named James and Ted and she has an older sister named Beth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=maise-shares-a-beautiful-bond-with-her-brother-james></span>Maise Shares A Beautiful Bond With Her Brother James<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>James is a history major and he is also interested in body art, according to the Irish Times. She is very close to both of her brothers and she often posts pictures with them on her social media accounts. She posted a picture of her doing acrobatics with her brothers and explained that her brothers are the best thing in this world.</p><p>Her brother James and Maisie also posted a picture of them doing their nails together. Williams also shared a picture of a text exchange she had with her brother James in 2014, just before the Bristol Pride Festival, in which James expressed his intention to go in a woman’s costume and requested Maisie apply his makeup.</p><p>So the relationship between Maise and James is solid. Her brother Ted is reportedly a break-dance instructor. She is also very close to her brother Ted and has posted pictures with him on different occasions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=maise-williams-and-her-sister-beth></span>Maise Williams and Her Sister Beth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Maisie’s older sister Beth gave birth in 2015. Williams took this opportunity to announce the birth of her sister’s baby on her Twitter account and explained that she has a reason to make the world a better place now. She also congratulated her sister and expressed how proud she is of her.</p><p>Beth loves to sing, according to the Irish Times which makes her another Williams family member who at least has an interest in the arts.&nbsp;According to Maisie Williams, she used to frequently perform for her family, including her elder brothers. Before Maisie was exposed to a large audience, her family was her first audience and also her biggest fans.</p><p>Williams’s family and siblings have been very supportive of her career. Even though Maisie’s mother suffered from cancer, she was able to fight it and now she is a cancer survivor. Maisie talked about how strong her mother is for looking after her family while also battling Cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=maisie-williams-upbringing-and-childhood></span>Maisie Williams Upbringing And Childhood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Young Maisie experienced an unremarkable childhood in Clutton, according to her. She was raised in a public housing development in Britain, went to regular schools, and earned regular grades. Maisie grew up with her older siblings at Clutton in Somerset, England, where her mother reared her on her own.</p><p>Despite this, Maisie clung to her aspirations of being a successful dancer because she thought they would have a significant impact on her life. Before continuing on to Norton Hill School in Midsomer Norton, Maisie had her foundational education at Clutton Primary School.</p><p>Maisie attended high school and took dancing classes at Susan Hill’s School of Dance in addition to her coursework. When Maisie was 11 years old, her dance instructor persuaded her to register for a talent show that featured workshops and seminars designed to assist kids to develop their acting, dancing, and singing talents.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-early-career></span>Her Early Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After participating in the talent event, Maisie met Louise Johnson, an agent, who encouraged her to try out for acting opportunities. Maisie wasn’t one to easily give up on her ambitions to pursue a career as a dancer and establish herself as a professional. Nevertheless, she rose to the occasion and continued on to a Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang audition.</p><p>A determined Maisie gave it to her all throughout the auditions and made it to the final two, but she was unable to land any roles in either of the television programs because she just appeared too young. Moving on, Maisie Williams went on an acting trial and landed the role of Arya Stark, a tomboyish avenging swordswoman on the popular HBO television series “Game of Thrones.”</p><p>She got favorable reviews for her performance in the series, which debuted in 2011, and was honored in 2012 with the Portal Award for Best Young Actor as well as the Portal Award for Best Supporting Actress in Television. The rest is merely history.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=maisie-williams-career-after-game-of-thrones></span>Maisie Williams Career After Game Of Thrones<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Game of Thrones filming schedule gave Maisie Williams the freedom to pursue further acting possibilities. On the BBC miniseries The Secret of Crickley Hall, which was based on renowned British horror author James Herbert’s book of the same name, she played one of her first parts outside of Game of Thrones.</p><p>The next films she appeared in were Heatstroke, Gold, The Falling, and The Book of Love. Williams also had an appearance in the Doctor Who TV show. She also appeared in iBoy, Mary Shelley, and Then Came You as her budding career progressed. Her most problematic production then followed.</p><p>Daisy Chain Productions, a tiny business that started in early 2016 and makes short films, is also co-founded by Maisie Williams. Given her rocky past with social media, Williams also contributed to the creation of the social networking app Daisie.</p><p>Because of her popularity in Game of Thrones, Maisie Williams now has a lot of freedom to explore the world of filmmaking. Williams has recently made appearances on the horror film The Owners as well as the British TV series Two Weeks to Live.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-siblings-does-maisie-williams-have></span>How Many Siblings Does Maisie Williams Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Maisie Williams have three siblings, Ted, James, and Beth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-was-maisie-williams-born></span>Where Was Maisie Williams Born?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Maisie Williams was born in Bristol, England.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-maisie-williams-parents></span>Who Are Maisie Williams Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Maisie Williams’s parents are Gary Williams and Hilary Pitt Frances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRnsCqsYywoKWkmZa6tHnPmqmepqSoeqit0bJksKGcobaiudJmmKecXZ22ra3RsmSpoaSpeqe%2BwKeanqtdmbymv4ysn55lmJbDpnnAp7Bmq5mXuaq6xqxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fmaisie-williams-parents-gary-williams-and-hilary-pitt-frances-does-she-have-any-siblings-11194.html&text=Maisie%20Williams%20Parents%20Gary%20Williams%20and%20Hilary%20Pitt%20Frances%2c%20Does%20She%20Have%20Any%20Siblings%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fmaisie-williams-parents-gary-williams-and-hilary-pitt-frances-does-she-have-any-siblings-11194.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fmaisie-williams-parents-gary-williams-and-hilary-pitt-frances-does-she-have-any-siblings-11194.html&title=Maisie%20Williams%20Parents%20Gary%20Williams%20and%20Hilary%20Pitt%20Frances%2c%20Does%20She%20Have%20Any%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fmaisie-williams-parents-gary-williams-and-hilary-pitt-frances-does-she-have-any-siblings-11194.html&title=Maisie%20Williams%20Parents%20Gary%20Williams%20and%20Hilary%20Pitt%20Frances%2c%20Does%20She%20Have%20Any%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fmaisie-williams-parents-gary-williams-and-hilary-pitt-frances-does-she-have-any-siblings-11194.html&title=Maisie%20Williams%20Parents%20Gary%20Williams%20and%20Hilary%20Pitt%20Frances%2c%20Does%20She%20Have%20Any%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fmaisie-williams-parents-gary-williams-and-hilary-pitt-frances-does-she-have-any-siblings-11194.html&description=Maisie%20Williams%20Parents%20Gary%20Williams%20and%20Hilary%20Pitt%20Frances%2c%20Does%20She%20Have%20Any%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Update/manila-luzon-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-boyfriend-family-salary-and-net-worth-11216.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Manila Luzon Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Boyfriend Family, Salary and Net Worth.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Celeb/lauren-london-parents-meet-arthur-hardy-lesha-london-11201.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren London Parents: Meet Arthur Hardy &amp;amp; Lesha London">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
