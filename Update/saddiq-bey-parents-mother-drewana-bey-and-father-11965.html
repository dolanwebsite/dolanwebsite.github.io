He has raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., where he also learned to play basketball.</p><p>His parents belong to the African-American ethnic background and are Christian. There is significantly less mention of his father, which hints that Sad’s mother raised him mostly, but it has been confirmed neither by the player nor by his mother.</p><figure></figure><p>Although Bey’s mother was a principal, a president, and a former player for another college, he spent his first year at DeMatha Catholic High School before going to Sidwell Friends School. The 23-year-old player participated in D.C. Premier’s AAU league.</p><p>He started as a freshman at 5’9″ and grew throughout high school. Bey helped Sidwell win the conference title as a junior. As a senior, he suffered an ankle injury and missed several games.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=saddiqs-mother-drewana-bey-played-college-basketball></span>Saddiq’s Mother Drewana Bey Played College Basketball<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Saddiq Bey is not the only baller in the family; moreover, he might have inherited his talent from his mother, Drewana Bey. She was a basketball player during her college years for the Charlotte 49ers.</p><p>According to the official website of&nbsp;Charlotte 49ers, Bey, a 6-footer forward from Largo, Maryland, started 71 of her 107 games throughout her tenure with the 49ers under head coach Ed Baldwin from 1995 to 1998.</p><p>Drewana saw an increase in workload and output each season. As a junior, she was the team’s leading rebounder and contributed to the program’s home overtime upset of No. 6-ranked Alabama with a double-double of 16 points and 17 rebounds. This was one of eight double-doubles she recorded that year.</p><figure></figure><p>She started all but one of the 28 games and averaged 10.3 points and 6.1 rebounds per game, earning her the Team MVP award in her senior year, 1997–1998. Drewana was a force from the first tip and finished her undergraduate career with three more double-doubles, including a 20-point, 19-rebound effort against Radford in the first game.</p><p>She scored 20 points in four more games against Conference USA foes, including back-to-back contests against Marquette and DePaul.</p><p>Bey has worked in education ever since she graduated, first as a teacher and now as Cluster 8’s Instructional Superintendent of Secondary Schools for the District of Columbia Public Schools.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=saddiq-beys-mom-is-his-biggest-critic></span>Saddiq Bey’s Mom Is His Biggest Critic<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dwane Casey works as a demanding coach to Detroit Piston’s youngster, but it indeed doesn’t compare to his mother, Dr. Drewana Bey, who doesn’t spare words or lessen expectations on those long drives home.</p><p>“I was pretty critical. He was so harsh that I thought he couldn’t even defend a stop sign.” Drewana, who is currently the Instructional Superintendent for the Washington D.C. Public Schools, stated to Yahoo Sports</p><p>She also said that Saddiq was incapable of playing defense. “He was a shooter all the time. However, defense? Anyone could avoid him.</p><p>According to his mother, he wasn’t fast, and her family played ball, but neither she nor the player’s father was swift. However, the critical mom also said that he got that straight.</p><p>To Saddiq’s credit, and in keeping with the professionalism he emits, he remained silent and never commented on his mother’s blunt observations.</p><figure></figure><p>“I pounced quite hard on him. After a game, Drewana stated, “You think you’re going to play? I told you that I didn’t feel like he was aggressive enough. Even your middle school squad won’t accept you.” she added.</p><p>Instead, she became his most excellent motivator because she thought that if he could win his mother over, he could win anyone over. It was “a blessing in disguise,” he said.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=saddiq-mother-beat-him-in-basketball></span>Saddiq&nbsp;Mother Beat Him In Basketball<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Drewana recalls the one occasion she stepped onto a basketball court to play against her 9-year-old son at his friend’s house, stressing that Saddiq was well-behaved, aware of his surroundings, and mild-mannered.</p><p>She claims that after seeing Saddiq and his friend score against the huge child on the court, who ended up joining the University of Maryland’s offensive line, she was asked to level the playing field.</p><p>Drewana’s switch exit helped settle the score but enraged her quiet yet hyper-competitive son. She wasn’t scoring on them; all she was doing was setting up the taller youngster to score.</p><p>However, she wasn’t allowing Saddiq to get any open shots or shots.&nbsp;“I wasn’t among those who would allow you to score. He’s becoming so angry because I’m blocking his shots,” Drewana stated.</p><p>Ultimately, out of frustration, he gave her hard fouls as harsh as a 9-year-old can deliver.</p><p>Saddiq was obviously upset and briefly clenched his fists, which was a rare instance of letting his emotions get the better. Even though it wasn’t time to leave, the game ended, and Drewana needed to take her son home.</p><p>Saddiq refers to basketball as his “obsession” and blames the occurrence on his competitive nature, which he notes is a quality shared by both his mother and himself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tyler-bey-the-brother-of-saddiq-bey></span>Is Tyler Bey The Brother Of Saddiq Bey?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tyler Bey, another NBA player, was rumored to be related to Saddiq Bey as they both shared the same last name and played in NBA. However, these speculations are not true, and they are not connected.</p><p>Tyler, 24, is a successful American professional basketball player for Ironi Ness Ziona of the Israeli Premier League. He represented Colorado Buffaloes in college basketball.</p><p>Bey spent his childhood in Las Vegas, where he was born and raised by his mother, Toya Maya. In the seventh grade, he began playing basketball competitively. As a junior, he participated in sports for Sunrise Manor, Nevada’s Las Vegas High School.</p><figure></figure><p>The Ironi Ness Ziona player changed schools and enrolled at Middlebrooks Academy in Los Angeles. He drew the attention of other NCAA Division I schools and got scholarship offers from UNLV, San Diego State, Arizona State, and Utah.</p><p>He committed to play college basketball for Colorado on September 10, 2016. Bey was rated as a three-star recruit by ESPN but four stars by 247Sports and Rivals.</p><p>Tyler and Saddiq have different parents, and they do not share any relationship as a family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bey-prefers-a-single-lifestyle></span>Bey Prefers A Single Lifestyle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Saddiq Bey is currently single and has not announced any interest to date anytime soon. Instead, he has been focusing on his career more than ever, proving to be a wise move seeing his success.</p><figure></figure><p>Bey has not posted any pictures of anyone that suggest his current partner, and he is not seen with others in public. He also rarely posts on&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and has only seven posts with more than 57K followers.</p><p>It is not sure that Saddiq will be dating soon, but considering his name and fame, it is just unpredictable.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-saddiq-bey-has-a-girlfriend></span>Does Saddiq Bey has a girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>No, Saddiq Bey is currently single and has not hinted his relationships.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-saddiq-beys-mother></span>Who is Saddiq Bey’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Drewana Bey, the mother of Saddiq Bey, is a former high school principal.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-team-does-saddiq-bey-play-for></span>What team does Saddiq Bey play for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bey plays for Detroit Pistons after being drafted in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuRmbGqvYybnLJloJa%2FprrTrGSmp6SdsrN5w6ucsJmelnqjsdhmmKecXZuutbTEq2RrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fsaddiq-bey-parents-mother-drewana-bey-and-father-11965.html&text=Saddiq%20Bey%20Parents%2c%20Mother%20Drewana%20Bey%20And%20Father&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fsaddiq-bey-parents-mother-drewana-bey-and-father-11965.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fsaddiq-bey-parents-mother-drewana-bey-and-father-11965.html&title=Saddiq%20Bey%20Parents%2c%20Mother%20Drewana%20Bey%20And%20Father" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fsaddiq-bey-parents-mother-drewana-bey-and-father-11965.html&title=Saddiq%20Bey%20Parents%2c%20Mother%20Drewana%20Bey%20And%20Father" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fsaddiq-bey-parents-mother-drewana-bey-and-father-11965.html&title=Saddiq%20Bey%20Parents%2c%20Mother%20Drewana%20Bey%20And%20Father" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fsaddiq-bey-parents-mother-drewana-bey-and-father-11965.html&description=Saddiq%20Bey%20Parents%2c%20Mother%20Drewana%20Bey%20And%20Father" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/News/suzanne-yvonne-louis-11968.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suzanne Yvonne Louis">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Celeb/sacheen-littlefeather-husband-is-sacheen-littlefeather-married-11954.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sacheen Littlefeather Husband: Is Sacheen Littlefeather Married?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
