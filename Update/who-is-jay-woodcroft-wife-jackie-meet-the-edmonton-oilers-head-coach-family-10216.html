Inside His Married Life & Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jay Woodcroft’s wife is Jackie, who prefers to remain low profile. But, as the words spread on the web, the couple has been happily married for decades. They also have kids.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nevertheless, as most people are unaware, she is also an athlete. She is a professional softball player. In addition, the couple is reported to have met as NCAA scholarship students. Thus we believe they dated for some time before deciding to tie their knot together and promising to live together forever.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, we could not trace Jackie’s social media shares. The former Canadian professional ice hockey player is on Twitter and often shares the tweets. However, the couple might have chosen to keep their relationship and personal life low profile as there is no post regarding the couple on the internet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, we are still unaware of the precise date of when their relationship started. Although Jay is on Wikipedia, his details are not available there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Do Not Miss:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sammy Blais Parents And Family: Who Are Sébastien And Marie-Josée Blais?</span></p><h2 id=know-the-age-difference-between-jay-woodcroft-and-his-wife><span class=ez-toc-section id=know-the-age-difference-between-jay-woodcroft-and-his-wife></span> Know The Age Difference Between Jay Woodcroft And His Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jay and his wife’s age difference should not be much as they met as NCAA scholarship students. However, the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers is 45-years-old as he was born on 11 August 1976. But his partner’s detail is unavailable and has successfully remained low profile.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, his fans want him to show up with his wife in the media. But we are sure that she does not want to be in the former hockey player’s stardom spotlight. Fans are still trying to search for her social media on the web.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This Might Interest You:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Oscar Klefbom Girlfriend Maja Kåberg; Dating History And Relationship Timeline</span></p><h2 id=in-detail-about-jay-woodcroft-family-how-many-children-does-he-have><span class=ez-toc-section id=in-detail-about-jay-woodcroft-family-how-many-children-does-he-have></span> In Detail About Jay Woodcroft Family- How Many Children Does He Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to the Truest Canadian definition, Woodcroft explains that his family is a hockey family. He is born as the youngest child to his mother, Jem, a nurse, and father, Frank, who worked in sales. He has two brothers, the elder is Craig, and the middle one is Todd. Nevertheless, they all share an interest and passion for hockey.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jay is also thankful to his parents for their upbringing, which has led him and his brothers to be hard-working and goal-driven individuals. He also added that his family was supportive, and his father and mother helped him and his brothers achieve their dream.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Woodcroft started his own family with his wife, but we are unknown how many kids they have. However, he wants to give his upbringing to his kids so that they would also grow up to be passionate, successful individuals.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yjmLJlp6S8pa%2FRqJ2tZaees6Z5yZqapKGVYrqmsdNmq6GdXZqxrrvNraanZZ%2Beuaa%2B0mafnpmUYrCwrcKhZJ%2BZnZ65unmSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-jay-woodcroft-wife-jackie-meet-the-edmonton-oilers-head-coach-family-10216.html&text=Who%20Is%20Jay%20Woodcroft%20Wife%20Jackie%3f%20Meet%20The%20Edmonton%20Oilers%20Head%20Coach%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-jay-woodcroft-wife-jackie-meet-the-edmonton-oilers-head-coach-family-10216.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-jay-woodcroft-wife-jackie-meet-the-edmonton-oilers-head-coach-family-10216.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jay%20Woodcroft%20Wife%20Jackie%3f%20Meet%20The%20Edmonton%20Oilers%20Head%20Coach%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-jay-woodcroft-wife-jackie-meet-the-edmonton-oilers-head-coach-family-10216.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jay%20Woodcroft%20Wife%20Jackie%3f%20Meet%20The%20Edmonton%20Oilers%20Head%20Coach%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-jay-woodcroft-wife-jackie-meet-the-edmonton-oilers-head-coach-family-10216.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jay%20Woodcroft%20Wife%20Jackie%3f%20Meet%20The%20Edmonton%20Oilers%20Head%20Coach%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fwho-is-jay-woodcroft-wife-jackie-meet-the-edmonton-oilers-head-coach-family-10216.html&description=Who%20Is%20Jay%20Woodcroft%20Wife%20Jackie%3f%20Meet%20The%20Edmonton%20Oilers%20Head%20Coach%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Update/who-is-mark-valade-wife-molly-valade-everything-to-know-about-the-ceo-of-carhartt-10212.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Mark Valade Wife Molly Valade?
