He had his first Challenge Tour win at the 2019 Open de Portugal. Adrian made history by becoming the first Pole to earn European Tour membership as he finished in the top 15 on the Challenge Tour’s Road to Mallorca in 2019.</p><p>He played college golf at East Tennessee State University. In his freshman season, he was named Second Team All-Atlantic Sun and Atlantic Sun All-Freshman Team and received Atlantic Sun All-Academic honors.

He received All-American honors from PING and Golfweek, while also being selected to the PING All-Region Team. He was also named SoCon Player of the Year, First Team All-Southern Conference and SoCon Player of the Month (April), and was named to the SoCon Academic Honor Roll. He skipped his senior season to turn pro.</p><p>Prior to ETSU, Adrian was the No. 1-ranked player in 2011 according to the World Junior Golf Rankings. He finished second in the World Junior Golf Series season ending Gate American Junior in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. to lock up the No. 1 ranking.</p><p>As an amateur, Meronk won the Polish Junior Championship and finished runner-up at the Polish Amateur Championship in 2011. In September 2014, he won the season-opening tournament at Inverness Intercollegiate and earned co-medalist honors at the Wolfpack Intercollegiate in October 2014.</p><p>Meronk represented Poland in the Eisenhower Trophy in 2012, 2014, 2016. He also played for Europe in the Arnold Palmer Cup in 2015 and 2016, being part of the winning team in 2016. He became the first Polish player to appear in the Palmer Cup.</p><p>He turned professional in 2016.

The professional golfer does not have a wife.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adrian-meronk-parents></span> Adrian Meronk Parents<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is the son of Andrzej and Joanna Meronk. The professional golfer was born in Hamburg, Germany. He explained to European Tour’s Player Blog: “My mother had taken a job to work in a hospital there.”</p><p>While in Germany, his father got really into golf and it was inevitable that the younger Meronk would get into golf too. He told Player Blog: “My parents decided to move back to their home country when I was two years old and we’ve lived here ever since. It was important that they went to Germany, though, as that was where my dad got really into golf. After he got hooked on it, it was inevitable that I would get into golf too. Whenever we went on holiday we’d go to hot places like Spain so we could play, and I would caddie for him in amateur events as he was one of the best amateurs in Poland – he played off three and would do really well as there weren’t many golfers in the country at the time!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adrian-meronk-net-worth></span> Adrian Meronk Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adrian Meronk’s net worth is estimated to be €1 million.
