Dave walked alongside the highway screaming at last.</p><p>In his first appearance on the show, he detailed his service and was even ready to prove his action through pictures.&nbsp;Vernon Adkison&nbsp;asked him to come by tomorrow at 8.00 am. On his first day, he asked a favor to look at a crew member’s weight belt.</p><figure></figure><p>They even realized the essential things they didn’t have on board at the last minute. A weight belt is fundamental for a diving crew which keeps them from floating back to the surface. They thought they screwed up again.</p><p>As a result, the commercial ship pilot asked Dave to chill out as they worked on the gear together. The pilot was unsure whether Dave was backing up or having a meltdown.</p><p>At first, he just stood at the end of the dock and talked to himself. The driver suddenly decided to walk home and screamed profanities at the ground. Then out of nowhere, he yelled like a madman at a tractor.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-diver-dave-still-on-the-show></span>Is Diver Dave Still On The Show?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dave quit the show on the first day. He freaked out after he stepped out of the boat when they didn’t have a weight belt. As a result, he backed out and left, saying these people were an idiot. In 2021, he shared being filmed returning to Vernon’s boat.</p><p>The driver posted he was back after finishing the Gold Rush of Nome, Alaska. He added this turned into a learning vacation that ended him being on another episode of the show.</p><figure></figure><p>The show found out about his return from captain Vernon. As a result, they shot their reunion and left the dock that same day.</p><p>Dave mentioned his departure was filmed for the show on September 14, 2021. It was emotional, and he warned the cameraman Nate about the Spigot. Also, Vernon has offered him command of a 6”, and he said if the captain makes it happen, he will be on show.</p><p>In early January 2022, he shared that the producer asked to use his sponge pics from FB on the episode, which was shot on September 6. Finally, the driver returned in season 15, episode 4, No Jane, No Gain.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dave-joined-the-show-as-a-diver></span>Dave Joined The Show As A Diver<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dave made his impression as a driver on Bering Sea Gold in Season 2, episode 2. The former Merchant Marine mentioned him as the hurricane at a jar.</p><p>They thought if they could harness his energy, the diver could turn into one aggressive driver.</p><figure></figure><p>The driver has worked as a commercial-rated hardhat driver for over 20 years. He also has his commercial sponge diving operation in the Gulf of Mexico. Besides this, he team crap at a Kodiak for two years, and his boat was in Homer named the Bassie M.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMoayrqpmYrq%2BxjJ2Yr51dqbWwuc%2Bspqdln6N6o7HRoqWgZaOarm6zzqWbaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-hurricane-dave-thompson-on-bering-sea-gold-10563.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Hurricane%20Dave%20Thompson%20On%20Bering%20Sea%20Gold%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-hurricane-dave-thompson-on-bering-sea-gold-10563.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-hurricane-dave-thompson-on-bering-sea-gold-10563.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Hurricane%20Dave%20Thompson%20On%20Bering%20Sea%20Gold%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-hurricane-dave-thompson-on-bering-sea-gold-10563.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Hurricane%20Dave%20Thompson%20On%20Bering%20Sea%20Gold%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-hurricane-dave-thompson-on-bering-sea-gold-10563.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Hurricane%20Dave%20Thompson%20On%20Bering%20Sea%20Gold%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fwhat-happened-to-hurricane-dave-thompson-on-bering-sea-gold-10563.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Hurricane%20Dave%20Thompson%20On%20Bering%20Sea%20Gold%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Update/what-is-glaive-real-name-everything-to-know-about-the-singer-height-instagram-and-net-worth-10593.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Glaive Real Name?
