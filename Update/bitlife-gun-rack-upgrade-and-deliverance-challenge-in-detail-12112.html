Meanwhile, you can examine the happiness stat of your game character.</p><p>On the 8th of April, 2023, Bitlife launched this new challenge where the players can earn money by renting out their trailer. Once all the aforementioned requirements are fulfilled by the players, anyone can participate in this new challenge.</p><p>Prior to that, Massive Gains Challenge, Nine to Five Challenge, Amongst Us Challenge, and many other others came out.

The ultimate goal is to lease out a trailer with the Gun Rack.</p><p>The Landlord expansion pack is priced at $5. Trailers are the moving house or campers that are an integral part of this challenge.</p><p>Ever since its launch in 2018, BitLife has made a name as one of the most successful and interesting life simulator games, and this challenge is equally mind-blowing.</p><p>This challenge is based on the 1972 American thriller movie titled Deliverance, as well as Bitlife Landlord update that came out in March. For participating in this latest challenge by BitLife, the human character should be 18, because he can not involve in real estate activities unless he reaches this age.</p><p>The requirements that need to be completed before embarking upon this adventure are mentioned below:</p><li>The player should be a Louisiana native born as a man.</li><li>He should be an adroit Banjo player.</li><li>He should possess over 10 trailers and upgrade them.</li><li>It is necessary to have tenants in more than 5 trailers.</li><li>A trailer with a gun rack must be rented out at the end.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-get-a-gun-rack-in-bitlife></span>How To Get A Gun Rack In BitLife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can get a gun rack in BitLife from the Key Features option during the time of property listing.</p><p>It should be noted that Gun Rack will not pop up immediately, but as you continue to flip houses, rent out trailers, and upgrade your properties, it will come up eventually.</p><p>For carrying out this challenge effectively, you need to have 10 trailers at minimum. Among them, 5 should be occupied by tenants which should compulsorily include the one with a gun rack.</p><p>It is necessary to obtain a gun rack because, in order to complete this challenge, your client must receive a gun rack from you. After going through all these ordeals, you can celebrate your victory.</p><p>You will be awarded your well-deserved prize which may include either a hat, eyewear, or any other accessories.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-be-born-in-louisiana-in-bitlife></span>How To Be Born In Louisiana In BitLife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can be born in Louisiana in BitLife by selecting America as your country at the start of the game.</p><p>There are enough options for you to personalize your online character in BitLife. Your name to all other attributes including country of origin and city can be specified through a click.</p><p>The player can pick any location among the 304 cities of Louisiana state after choosing the United States of America. New Orleans, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport are some of the options from which you can choose as they all belong to Louisiana.</p><p>It is mandatory to follow these steps because unless you are from the 25th most populated state in the U.S., you can not go ahead with the tasks.</p><p>Moreover, it becomes fruitless to attempt this challenge if your character is not a male, so, it is obligatory to set the identity of the player to Male.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-become-a-landlord-in-bitlife></span>How To Become A Landlord In BitLife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can become a landlord in BitLife by erecting an advertisement to bring in prospective occupants.</p><p>However, you need to own a property to bring in clients, which can be done by purchasing the Landlord Expansion Pack at first. After having access to this premium feature, you can buy the house of your choice.</p><p>But owning housing is not enough. From time to time, you need to keep updating and upgrading your properties in order to lure in residents.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=here-are-a-few-steps-to-rent-out-your-property-in-bitlife-and-make-some-money></span>Here are a few steps to rent out your property in BitLife and make some money.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Firstly, you need to go to the main menu and open the Assets.</li><li>Secondly, go through the Real Estate tab and right-click the Properties option.</li><li>Next, choose the apartment that you would like to set aside for customers.</li><li>Then, click on the Rent option. For advertisement, you can customize it as per your wish.</li><li>After that, select the Post icon, and your house will be seen in the market.</li><p>On a side note, it is important to do a background check on your tenant before making the decision. It is because there are many clients who will show up, and who knows if they are criminals or genuine buyers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-become-a-monk-in-bitlife></span>How To Become A Monk In BitLife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can become a monk in BitLife by following the path of utmost purity.</p><p>After 4 years of its release, the developers of BitLife brought in this new feature where the users can turn themselves into monks or whatever they aspire to be. This has helped in elevating the hype of this app immensely.</p><p>In simple terms, a monk is a man who abstains from the physical pleasures of life and lives in a monastery with like-minded people.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=steps-to-becoming-a-monk></span>Steps to Becoming a Monk<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>So what if you can not follow the path of spirituality in real life, you can follow these steps and experience being a monk virtually.</p><li>First of all, you need to complete your high school education and select the Monk career from the list of available jobs.</li><li>You should abstain from all sorts of physical intimacies, although you can date around.</li><li>Not only that, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, and smoking cigarettes are out of the question.</li><li>Both body and mind should be healthy and fit. So, one should indulge in activities like yoga, exercise, and meditation. If necessary, medical check-ups should be done.</li><p>It is necessary that your human character is male, before following these procedures. But if you identify as a man, and continue the above-mentioned rituals incessantly for 75 years, you will achieve your aim of becoming a monk.</p><p>After that, you will live a disciplined life, filled with serenity and gratitude.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqZqbmqssRmnq6mXaeupLeMrqegqpGZsm6tzZ1knZ2cnsOmvsCnmp5lk52urbjEp56eZZmjeqWx05qgpWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fUpdate%2fbitlife-gun-rack-upgrade-and-deliverance-challenge-in-detail-12112.html&text=BitLife%20Gun%20Rack%20Upgrade%20And%20Deliverance%20Challenge%20In%20Detail&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fUpdate%2fbitlife-gun-rack-upgrade-and-deliverance-challenge-in-detail-12112.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fbitlife-gun-rack-upgrade-and-deliverance-challenge-in-detail-12112.html&title=BitLife%20Gun%20Rack%20Upgrade%20And%20Deliverance%20Challenge%20In%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fUpdate%2fbitlife-gun-rack-upgrade-and-deliverance-challenge-in-detail-12112.html&title=BitLife%20Gun%20Rack%20Upgrade%20And%20Deliverance%20Challenge%20In%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fUpdate%2fbitlife-gun-rack-upgrade-and-deliverance-challenge-in-detail-12112.html&title=BitLife%20Gun%20Rack%20Upgrade%20And%20Deliverance%20Challenge%20In%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fUpdate%2fbitlife-gun-rack-upgrade-and-deliverance-challenge-in-detail-12112.html&description=BitLife%20Gun%20Rack%20Upgrade%20And%20Deliverance%20Challenge%20In%20Detail" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/News/bruce-arena-age-wiki-biography-family-parents-body-measurement-salary-net-worth-12113.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bruce Arena Age, Wiki, Biography, Family, Parents, Body Measurement, Salary, Net worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Update/bill-peduto-wife-who-is-pittsburgh-mayor-married-to-family-and-children-12082.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bill Peduto Wife: Who Is Pittsburgh Mayor Married To?
