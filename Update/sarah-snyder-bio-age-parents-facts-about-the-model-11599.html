Her nationality is American while her ethnicity is Caucasian. The media personality has not revealed specific details about her early childhood or educational history. It is however understood that she grew up in the Big Apple before moving to California to further her professional career. With regards to her career, Sarah Snyder is a professional as well as an Instagram model. She is signed to Re: Quest Model Management and has done photoshoots for hair and makeup brand, Mary Gordon Beauty. The New York native has also featured in campaigns for high-end brands such as Uniqlo and Calvin Klein. Additionally, Snyder has been invited to fashion shows organized by designers such as Dolce & Gabbana and Versace.</p><p>Sarah Snyder has also utilized the power of the internet to boost her modeling career. Her glossy and sassily-titled Instagram account, sarahfuckingsnyder, is filled with pouty selfies, hot bikini photos and outfits of the day (OOTDs). These OOTDs normally comprise of highly coveted items such as vintage Harley Davison T-shirts, Gucci tops, ETC. Snyder expertly captures all this in the most millennial way possible, a bathroom selfie. The New Yorker has grown to become one of the most popular models on Instagram with not less than 1.7 million followers.</p><p>Asides from modeling, the multi-talented Snyder is also a budding actress. She has featured in several movies, most of the horror persuasion. They include Skeleton Key 2, Scarlet Rain, Greencastle, Dead Woman’s Hollow, and Night of the Living Dead: Genesis. Scarlet Rain is a horror film about a group of children who discover a change in their lives when their storybook tales inspire them to view their parents and neighbors in a whole new light. In the movie, Snyder played the role of one of such children named Dotty.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=parents></span><strong>Parents</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sarah Snyder has not disclosed specific details about her parents’ names or any potential siblings that she may have. However, her parents have been known to be supportive in times of trouble. For instance, in June 2015, the model was arrested by the Bedford County police and charged with larceny. She was accused of stealing a Hermes bag, worth thousands of dollars, from a New York shopping center. Snyder denied the allegations and produced time-stamped plane tickets, pictures and cell phone records to establish her innocence. She also provided her credit card statement, an affidavit sworn by her father, as well as pictures of herself at her dad’s home on the day of the theft. Despite all these, Snyder spent several hours in a holding cell before she could post bail. The charges were later dropped and the ever-sassy Snyder posted a selfie of herself wearing a t-shirt with her mug shot emblazoned on it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=boyfriend></span><strong>Boyfriend</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Snyder has had a captivating love life. She first dated a guy named Ian Connor from 2014 to 2015.&nbsp; The model thereafter dated actor, rapper, and Will Smith’s Son, Jaden Smith. She and Smith commenced their romance in early 2015 and did not shy away from packing on the PDA. They were photographed graphically smooching each other at New York Fashion Week 2015. The couple was also spotted all over each other during the premiere of Pitch Perfect 2 in May 2015. All in all, Snyder and Smith enjoyed a sizzling relationship until they broke things off in 2017. Some sources stated that the split was due to the couple growing apart. Others attributed it to Snyder allegedly cheating on Smith with a photographer named Gunner Stahl. Following the split, the couple moved on with their respective lives. Snyder, however, got into a subtle beef with reality TV star, and Jaden Smith’s Ex, Kylie Jenner. Jenner first set the ball rolling when she posted a selfie captioned kyliefuckingjenner, an obvious reference to Snyder’s Instagram handle. Snyder herself replied with a selfie captioned ‘one n only’. Thankfully, the beef did not last long as the ladies backed off from each other.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-facts-about-sarah-snyder></span><strong>Other Facts about Sarah Snyder</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>1</strong>.
