However, there have been no talks of the host leaving the platform, and he has not addressed anything of the sort.</p><p>Will has been working with Prager University for more than four years now and has seen major success in the last few years in his podcasts and shows with the rising issues of abortion, COVID, and racism.</p><p>The podcaster has gained more than 700 million online views, and his audience seems to love him. After joining the portal, he has written a book and has even featured on different media outlets like Fox News, Blaze Media, and The Daily Wire as a cultural commentator.</p><p>With the love and support he is getting on his current work, there are fewer chances of the influencer leaving Prager University. Also, he has a lot of projects he is currently working on with the portal, like he recently worked on the Storytime with Will Witt.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-witts-fiance-eva-vlaardingerbroek></span>Will Witt’s Fiance, Eva Vlaardingerbroek<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Will Witt recently got engaged to his girlfriend, Eva Vlaardingerbroek, in March 2022 after dating for less than a year. The couple started dating in late 2021 after being introduced by Dennis Prager.</p><p>The PragerU star’s fiance is an opinion maker and a host who has made appearances on Tucker Carlson Tonight as well.</p><p>Eva is a former law student who studied at the Utrecht University and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. She has even achieved her master’s degree in philosophy of law at Leiden University with honors in the essay “The contractualization of sex in the me-too era.”</p><p>Just like her fiance, Eva is also a right-wing activist and has published many opinion articles in newspapers as well. Both the couple have similar political opinions, including their opinions on vaccines.</p><p>Will is seen defending his fiance on Twitter, deleting her post about COVID vaccines, and bragging about being an anti-vaxer on Twitter.</p><p>Eva has worked for the party Forum for Democracy in the European parliament in Brussels but wanted to work as a researcher in Leiden. However, the young host left her position at the University of Leiden to pursue politics.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-will-witt-going></span>Where Is WIll Witt Going?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although the chances of Will Witt leaving Prager University are really low with his ongoing fame with PragerU, Will, like many other influencers, may decide to go solo after a few years.</p><p>We have seen it with many influencers working with a bigger company going solo and developing their own brand after gaining a certain amount of fan following and fame. And Will has earned a big fan following by now, so it won’t be a surprise if the influencer decides to go solo and start his own show independent of PragerU.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsSquMtmrqKspGK5pq3VoqWgZaCnrqix0Wasp6Gmmr%2B0tdOyZLCgkal6uLGMpKWor12Wr7DB02afoqtdm7aiusKeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fCeleb%2fis-will-witt-leaving-prager-university-what-we-know-about-his-fiance-12280.html&text=Is%20Will%20Witt%20Leaving%20Prager%20University%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20His%20Fiance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fCeleb%2fis-will-witt-leaving-prager-university-what-we-know-about-his-fiance-12280.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fis-will-witt-leaving-prager-university-what-we-know-about-his-fiance-12280.html&title=Is%20Will%20Witt%20Leaving%20Prager%20University%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20His%20Fiance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fCeleb%2fis-will-witt-leaving-prager-university-what-we-know-about-his-fiance-12280.html&title=Is%20Will%20Witt%20Leaving%20Prager%20University%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20His%20Fiance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fis-will-witt-leaving-prager-university-what-we-know-about-his-fiance-12280.html&title=Is%20Will%20Witt%20Leaving%20Prager%20University%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20His%20Fiance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fCeleb%2fis-will-witt-leaving-prager-university-what-we-know-about-his-fiance-12280.html&description=Is%20Will%20Witt%20Leaving%20Prager%20University%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20His%20Fiance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Update/jacques-agnant-aka-haitian-jack-net-worth-why-was-he-deported-12284.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jacques Agnant aka Haitian Jack Net Worth: Why Was He Deported?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/News/is-joc-pederson-gay-details-and-rumors-about-his-sexuality-12244.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Joc Pederson Gay?
