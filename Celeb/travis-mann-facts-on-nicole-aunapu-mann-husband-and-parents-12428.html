Mann. He is proud of Nicole for being the first native woman in space.</p><p>It is not known when the pair met; however, they have known each other since their flight school days in 2002. Eventually, the two started dating and turned their love into a beautiful marital bliss. The pair took their vows in 2009 and recently celebrated their 13th anniversary.</p><p>Her life partner is currently in his fifties. On the other hand, Nicole turned 45 this year. She was born in 1977, and her birth happened on June 27; she is a Cancer, as per the Zodiac sign.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nicoles-husband-serves-in-the-us-navy></span>Nicole’s Husband Serves In The U.S. Navy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicole Aunapu Mann’s husband, Travis R.

Mann’s first child, a son, was born in 2013. The same year, she was called up by NASA.</p><p>After giving birth, Mann took four months off from flying. She claimed that becoming a mother provides an even more incredible rush than flying faster than the speed of sound. Moreover, she has said that becoming a mother is one of the best experiences of her life.</p><p>Mann had to wait years before being assigned to a mission after being chosen for NASA’s astronaut corps in 2013. She had an intense 18-month preparation program after being transferred to Crew-5, which included practicing spacewalks underwater and learning Russian to improve communication with her cosmonaut counterparts.</p><p>Despite being a working mom, Mann gives plenty of time to her son, who is almost 10 years old. She previously revealed to National Geographic magazine that she and her kid frequently sat outside to see the moon. So she hoped her dear son might be able to witness her moonwalking one day.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-nicole-aunapu-manns-proud-parents></span>Meet Nicole Aunapu Mann’s Proud Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicole Aunapu Mann is the daughter of Victoria Anunapu and Howard Anunapu.</p><p>Her parents are incredibly proud of their daughter’s achievement, as she has created history by becoming the first Native American lady to reach the space. She has not stated much about her parents. However, it is known that she belonged to a family that served in the military for many generations.</p><p>In an interview, Mann said that her mother gave her a wooden hoop with thread webbing as a dream catcher when she was a little girl. The item will travel through space with her.</p><p>She&nbsp;said: “I do have this dream catcher that my mother gave me long ago,” Mann told NPR. “And that is always just, you know, a little bit of a piece memory; I think of my family back home, something I will keep with me in my crew quarters while I’m on board the space station.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-grew-up-in-penngrove-california></span>She Grew Up In Penngrove, California<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Mann and her son, Travis Mann, reside in Houston, her extended family (as well as her fan club) continues to call Northern California home.</p><p>In 1995, she earned her diploma from Rancho Cotate High School in Rohnert Park, California. She eventually graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 1999.</p><p>Nicole graduated from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, in 2001 with a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering focused on Fluid Mechanics.</p><p>Before joining a flight squadron in Virginia, she completed her flight training at the Naval Air Station Pensacola. Mann served in two Iraq War deployments before coming home to the US and enrolling in the US Naval Test Pilot School.</p><p>Mann was one of eight astronaut candidates chosen by NASA in June 2013 to serve in the 21st astronaut class, which would first focus on space station operations before considering assignments to missions to the moon, near-Earth asteroids, or eventually Mars.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-grandfather-emigrated-from-estonia></span>Her Grandfather Emigrated From Estonia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Helmuth Aunapu, Nicole’s grandfather, left Estonia as a young man in the 1920s and finally moved to the U.S. He joined the U.S. Army and participated in World War II as a military engineer, rising to lieutenant colonel.</p><p>Her grandad passed away when Nicole Mann’s father, Howard, was just 11 years old; thus, sadly, Nicole Mann never got to meet her grandfather.</p><p>Nicole Mann stated to the&nbsp;Estonian daily Postimees&nbsp;in 2020, “Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity to meet him, and I do not have much direct idea of our family’s Estonian heritage.”</p><p>After she returns from space, Mann said she might travel to Estonia, the nation where her grandfather was born. She said: “I am aware that we have family in Estonia. My older sister has the same enthusiasm for our Estonian heritage. I’m hoping we can travel together” in an interview in 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nicole-is-proud-of-her-ethnicity></span>Nicole Is Proud Of Her Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the Round Valley Indian Tribes, Mann is recognized as a Native American.</p><p>She was raised in Northern California and is a registered member of the Wailacki tribe, which is part of the Round Valley post-colonial reserve that includes several Indigenous tribes coerced there in the middle of the 1800s.</p><p>As stated in&nbsp;CNN, Mann has said: “A lot of my extended family still lives in that area,” Mann told Indian Country Today in August. “We got together a couple of weeks ago for a family reunion. So it’s really important, I think, for us to continue to create those bonds.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-net-worth-in-2022></span>Her Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicole Aunapu Mann’s net worth figure is estimated to be in the millions.</p><p>Mann has earned her fortune by serving her nation and working as a NASA astronaut. In addition, she has worked for the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Tailhook Association, U.S. Naval Test Pilot School Alumni Association, and United States Naval Academy Alumni Association.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Business Insider, The government uses a pay scale to set the annual salary of astronauts, who typically start in one of two grades: GS-12 or GS-13. Currently, a GS-12 starts at $65,140 per year, and a GS-13 can earn up to $100,701 per year.</p><p>Thus, astronauts like Mann earn between $66,167 and $161,141 per year.</p><p>As per NASA.gov, To receive salary, benefits, leave, and other similar military considerations, military astronaut candidates must be assigned to the Johnson Space Center and maintain an active duty status.</p><p>Throughout her career, Nicole has been awarded many honors. She has two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals and two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. Similarly, she received the Jerry Yeagley Award for Exceptional Personal Achievement in 2017 and was inducted into the Academic All-American Hall of Fame.</p><p>Mann, who is a potential candidate to be one of the first women to walk on the moon, hopes that by setting an example, more Native Americans and women may choose to become astronauts in the coming future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyilsOqv4ymmKemXZuupMDSZqanZZ6esLC4xGaYrqaRpcJuucCnpWagpaivorrDZpinnF2lrrOxza2qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fCeleb%2ftravis-mann-facts-on-nicole-aunapu-mann-husband-and-parents-12428.html&text=Travis%20Mann%3a%20Facts%20On%20Nicole%20Aunapu%20Mann%20Husband%20and%20Parents&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fCeleb%2ftravis-mann-facts-on-nicole-aunapu-mann-husband-and-parents-12428.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2ftravis-mann-facts-on-nicole-aunapu-mann-husband-and-parents-12428.html&title=Travis%20Mann%3a%20Facts%20On%20Nicole%20Aunapu%20Mann%20Husband%20and%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fCeleb%2ftravis-mann-facts-on-nicole-aunapu-mann-husband-and-parents-12428.html&title=Travis%20Mann%3a%20Facts%20On%20Nicole%20Aunapu%20Mann%20Husband%20and%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2ftravis-mann-facts-on-nicole-aunapu-mann-husband-and-parents-12428.html&title=Travis%20Mann%3a%20Facts%20On%20Nicole%20Aunapu%20Mann%20Husband%20and%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fCeleb%2ftravis-mann-facts-on-nicole-aunapu-mann-husband-and-parents-12428.html&description=Travis%20Mann%3a%20Facts%20On%20Nicole%20Aunapu%20Mann%20Husband%20and%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Update/unfoonk-biography-and-net-worth-real-name-untold-facts-12431.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Unfoonk Biography and Net Worth: Real Name, Untold facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Update/tom-claeren-wikipedia-net-worth-girlfriend-instagram-12449.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Claeren Wikipedia, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Instagram">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
