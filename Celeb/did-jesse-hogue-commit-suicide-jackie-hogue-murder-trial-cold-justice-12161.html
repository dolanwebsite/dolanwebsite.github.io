The handgun being used to murder Jackie has never been found, and no one has ever been charged with her murder.</p><p>There was no trace of forced entry, and burglary was ruled out, according to detectives. The case had been reviewed several times, according to CBS Amarillo, but each time detectives fell just short.</p><p>The episode of Cold Justice on Oxygen looks to have been the most important component in solving the case. Fresh relevant evidence was discovered that strengthened the case against Jesse Hogg, the attorney’s office for Colorado’s forty-seventh district.</p><p>The eyewitness in the case reportedly remarked something about how Jesse reacted after the incident in the episode.</p><p>Witnesses claimed that Jesse intended to return to a time while his wife Jackie was still living and that the police were unable to apprehend him since the utilized weaponry, a gun, was missing.</p><p>This appeared to be a pivotal point in the inquiry, and Jesse was charged and imprisoned as a result of these revelations.</p><p>The 47th District Attorney’s Office was submitted a reasonable suspicion statement, and an arrest warrant for Hogue was issued.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jesse-hogue-dateline-his-arrest-charges-mugshots></span>Jesse Hogue Dateline: His Arrest Charges & Mugshots<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>73-year-old Jesse Hogue was arrested&nbsp;on a Potter County homicide warrant&nbsp;by Sheriff’s Detectives with the help of the US Marshals Service.</p><p>Hogue was found guilty of killing his former wife Jackie Hogg in 1994. The murder case had been overlooked before Kelly Siegler’s “Chilly Justice” team looked into her homicide this season.</p><p>Reportedly, Jesse was seen heading towards Platteville Boulevard and North Raymont Drive in Pueblo West. He was apprehended without incident after law authorities pulled him over.</p><p>Upon being detained for traffic on 21 March 2019, he was sentenced to jail in Colorado without bond. Afterward when, he was scheduled to be transferred to a Texas prison, according to Oxygen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqrsdKsnGagn5zCpnnCqKSmoaRiwLa1wqKbnmWalrCstcRmn6ifpZp6rsHRnZyrZaSntqK4jJympZxdn8K0wMicnGZqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fCeleb%2fdid-jesse-hogue-commit-suicide-jackie-hogue-murder-trial-cold-justice-12161.html&text=Did%20Jesse%20Hogue%20Commit%20Suicide%3f%20Jackie%20Hogue%20Murder%20Trial%20%26amp%3b%20Cold%20Justice&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fCeleb%2fdid-jesse-hogue-commit-suicide-jackie-hogue-murder-trial-cold-justice-12161.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fdid-jesse-hogue-commit-suicide-jackie-hogue-murder-trial-cold-justice-12161.html&title=Did%20Jesse%20Hogue%20Commit%20Suicide%3f%20Jackie%20Hogue%20Murder%20Trial%20%26amp%3b%20Cold%20Justice" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fCeleb%2fdid-jesse-hogue-commit-suicide-jackie-hogue-murder-trial-cold-justice-12161.html&title=Did%20Jesse%20Hogue%20Commit%20Suicide%3f%20Jackie%20Hogue%20Murder%20Trial%20%26amp%3b%20Cold%20Justice" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fdid-jesse-hogue-commit-suicide-jackie-hogue-murder-trial-cold-justice-12161.html&title=Did%20Jesse%20Hogue%20Commit%20Suicide%3f%20Jackie%20Hogue%20Murder%20Trial%20%26amp%3b%20Cold%20Justice" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fCeleb%2fdid-jesse-hogue-commit-suicide-jackie-hogue-murder-trial-cold-justice-12161.html&description=Did%20Jesse%20Hogue%20Commit%20Suicide%3f%20Jackie%20Hogue%20Murder%20Trial%20%26amp%3b%20Cold%20Justice" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Celeb/dr-paul-osteen-net-worth-lisa-osteen-brother-age-wiki-md-bio-facts-12191.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dr Paul Osteen Net Worth (Lisa Osteen Brother) Age, Wiki, MD, Bio Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Celeb/did-carmen-and-corey-break-up-youtubers-on-open-relationship-12178.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Carmen and Corey Break Up?
