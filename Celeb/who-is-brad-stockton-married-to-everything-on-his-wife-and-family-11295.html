He was on the 2001 Amateur draft at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he graduated from both his school and college.</p><p>He was considered a talented player, and many claimed him to be a future superstar. However, after few seasons, he retired from the sport, and we have no information about him since then.</p><p>Since he only played briefly on the highest level, it might be the reason he has not been featured on Wikipedia.</p><p>Talking about his age, rad Stockton’s age is&nbsp;<strong>41 years old&nbsp;</strong>as of 2021.</p><p>He was born on the 28th of July, 1979.

It is unclear whether he is married or single.</p><p>Therefore, we don’t have any details regarding his wife. Similarly, he is not on any social media platforms, which makes it even harder to get his details.</p><p>It has been more than 18 years since he was active in baseball; he has been away from the limelight for quite some time. Thus, there is little to no information on the former MLB player.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ybqZqcXajBsK%2FKraanZZ2Wv7O1xJ1kraddmsOmvtitn6Kml2K8r3nHoqpmr5mbsm6tzZ1kn5mdnrm6ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fCeleb%2fwho-is-brad-stockton-married-to-everything-on-his-wife-and-family-11295.html&text=Who%20Is%20Brad%20Stockton%20Married%20To%3f%20Everything%20On%20His%20Wife%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fCeleb%2fwho-is-brad-stockton-married-to-everything-on-his-wife-and-family-11295.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fwho-is-brad-stockton-married-to-everything-on-his-wife-and-family-11295.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brad%20Stockton%20Married%20To%3f%20Everything%20On%20His%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fCeleb%2fwho-is-brad-stockton-married-to-everything-on-his-wife-and-family-11295.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brad%20Stockton%20Married%20To%3f%20Everything%20On%20His%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fwho-is-brad-stockton-married-to-everything-on-his-wife-and-family-11295.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brad%20Stockton%20Married%20To%3f%20Everything%20On%20His%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fCeleb%2fwho-is-brad-stockton-married-to-everything-on-his-wife-and-family-11295.html&description=Who%20Is%20Brad%20Stockton%20Married%20To%3f%20Everything%20On%20His%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Hot%20News/who-is-denise-coleman-everything-on-vince-coleman-wife-11308.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Denise Coleman?
