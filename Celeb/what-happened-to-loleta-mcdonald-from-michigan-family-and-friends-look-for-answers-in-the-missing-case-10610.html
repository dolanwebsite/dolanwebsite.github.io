Loleta was in her early 50s, about 5 feet and six inches tall, and had light eyes. She had an average-built body and also blonde hair.</p><p>On June 11, 2022, Loleta’s sister posted through her social media that Loleta had departed from this world. In a short statement, she expressed sincere thanks to all the concerned individuals who tried to help find her after she mysteriously disappeared early this month. She also asked everyone to maintain a state of privacy over the matter and help the family at the time of this grave sadness. The details of her death will soon follow as per Loleta’s sister’s post.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Is Loleta Mcdonald Still Missing In Michigan?">Is Loleta Mcdonald Still Missing In Michigan?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Details About Loleta Mcdonald’s Murder Rumors-Disappearance Or Homicide?">Details About Loleta Mcdonald’s Murder Rumors-Disappearance Or Homicide?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Is Rob Wilson The Suspect Behind Loleta McDonald’s missing?">Is Rob Wilson The Suspect Behind Loleta McDonald’s missing?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-loleta-mcdonald-still-missing-in-michigan></span>Is Loleta Mcdonald Still Missing In Michigan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loleta McDonald was missing from Macomb County since early June 2022. She was last seen in the region on June 4, 2022, and was nowhere to be found later. A massive search for the 51 years old was launched with the help of the rescue team, the close peers, the volunteers, and the involved authorities.</p><p>On June 11, 2022, Loleta’s death was stated by her sister through her social media statement. She thanked everyone involved in the nationwide big search and stated that the details of Loleta’s death is soon to follow. There was no indication of the place and date of her death or the initial cause of death as well.</p><p>The case is taking a twisted turn now and people are speculating a possible foul play in this Michigan disappearance case.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=details-about-loleta-mcdonalds-murder-rumors-disappearance-or-homicide></span>Details About Loleta Mcdonald’s Murder Rumors-Disappearance Or Homicide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loleta McDonald’s strange disappearance on June 4 has now taken a different turn as her family has recently posted a death statement about their beloved one. People and the close followers of the case are stating about a possible intrusion of a foreign factor in the missing case.</p><p>Although no proofs have been shared and no actual details on the death have been stated to date, speculation is high and a foul play factor has been suggested. The case is being handled by higher authorities and as per Loleta’s sister, more information is soon to follow.</p><p>The case of disappearance has now been treated as a homicide case by thousands and the case has been published in the missing/death case pages called ‘Scanner of Warren’ and ‘Missing in Michigan’ Facebook sites.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-rob-wilson-the-suspect-behind-loleta-mcdonalds-missing></span>Is Rob Wilson The Suspect Behind Loleta McDonald’s missing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Prior to the date when Loleta McDonald went missing, she was last with Rob Wilson. The pair were seen together last Saturday before Loleta’s mysterious and unjustified missing.</p><p>Rob has been blamed and accused by many as the actual perpetrator of the disappearance crime and is suggested to have attacked or possibly murdered Loleta after her missing.
