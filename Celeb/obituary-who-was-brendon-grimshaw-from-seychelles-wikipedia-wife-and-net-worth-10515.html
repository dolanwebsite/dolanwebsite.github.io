According to them, he passed away after suffering from some illness. However, it is not confirmed if his cause of death was an illness.</p><p>People love and appreciate Grimshaw’s story of how he owned Moyenne Island and turned it into his home. Then, in 1962, he went on vacation to Seychelles. It was an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean with only eight regularly inhabited islands.</p><p>He was an editor, working for several of East Africa’s largest publications. In addition, at the time, Tanzania had gained independence the previous year, and Kenya would follow a year later.</p><p>Thus, Grimshaw knew that jobs like his would soon be handed up to locals. As a result, he sought a new route in life, one that brought him closer to nature, knowing that he would soon be unemployed.</p><p>He dreamt about having property in Seychelles, ideally his island.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=find-brendon-grimshaw-story-on-wikipedia></span>Find Brendon Grimshaw Story On Wikipedia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The&nbsp;Wikipedia&nbsp;profile of Moyenne Island explains the story of its owner, Brendon Grimshaw. On the second-to-last day of his visit, Rene Antoine Lafortune approached him and asked him if he wanted to buy an island.</p><p>Finally, he bought the island for £8,000 and made it livable. He set up his island with the help of Rene. Visitors were charged €12 to come ashore, wander the island, dine at the “Jolly Roger” restaurant, and relax on the beach.</p><p>Grimshaw and his friend planted 16,000 trees and erected 4.8 kilometers (3.0 miles) of nature walks. He also brought and reared Aldabra giant tortoises to create an island of breathtaking beauty.</p><p>Hence, the island is home to roughly 120 gigantic tortoises and diverse plant and birdlife.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-brendon-grimshaw-married-who-was-his-wife></span>Was Brendon Grimshaw Married?- Who Was His Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brendon Grimshaw did not have a wife as he never got married. Unfortunately, there is no information about his family life on the internet.</p><p>It is said that he and his friend used to look over the island after the purchase. Therefore, we assume he remained single until his death.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brendon-grimshaw-own-moyenne-island-what-was-his-net-worth></span>Brendon Grimshaw Own Moyenne Island- What Was His Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brendon Grimshaw, the owner of Moyenne island’s net worth, remained unexplored. However, the island he purchased for £8,000 was $50 million in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKeSnsG2rdGyZLCgn2LEor%2BMm6meppSku26z0aKkrKCRrHqnvs6mZKydqZi1prjLnqpmr5mgtrGxw6KYZq%2BZm7Jurc2dZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fCeleb%2fobituary-who-was-brendon-grimshaw-from-seychelles-wikipedia-wife-and-net-worth-10515.html&text=Obituary%3a%20Who%20Was%20Brendon%20Grimshaw%20From%20Seychelles%3f%20Wikipedia%20Wife%20And%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fCeleb%2fobituary-who-was-brendon-grimshaw-from-seychelles-wikipedia-wife-and-net-worth-10515.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fobituary-who-was-brendon-grimshaw-from-seychelles-wikipedia-wife-and-net-worth-10515.html&title=Obituary%3a%20Who%20Was%20Brendon%20Grimshaw%20From%20Seychelles%3f%20Wikipedia%20Wife%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fCeleb%2fobituary-who-was-brendon-grimshaw-from-seychelles-wikipedia-wife-and-net-worth-10515.html&title=Obituary%3a%20Who%20Was%20Brendon%20Grimshaw%20From%20Seychelles%3f%20Wikipedia%20Wife%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fobituary-who-was-brendon-grimshaw-from-seychelles-wikipedia-wife-and-net-worth-10515.html&title=Obituary%3a%20Who%20Was%20Brendon%20Grimshaw%20From%20Seychelles%3f%20Wikipedia%20Wife%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fCeleb%2fobituary-who-was-brendon-grimshaw-from-seychelles-wikipedia-wife-and-net-worth-10515.html&description=Obituary%3a%20Who%20Was%20Brendon%20Grimshaw%20From%20Seychelles%3f%20Wikipedia%20Wife%20And%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/News/reuben-cannon-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-10484.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reuben Cannon Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/News/natalie-newman-drew-lock-girlfriend-age-instagram-wiki-bio-and-net-worth-10492.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Newman: Drew Lock Girlfriend Age, Instagram, Wiki, Bio and Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
