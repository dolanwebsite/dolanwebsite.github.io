Buffer introduces a distinct announcing style in which he rolls certain letters and adds other conjugations to a fighter’s name. Bruce Buffer, his half-brother is also a UFC announcer.</p><p>In 2018, Buffer signed an exclusive contract with the DAZN streaming service to serve as ring announcer for their boxing cards.

Buffer, however, got a acquit.</p><p>He was incredibly told he might never speak again,&nbsp;But less than thirty days after the operation, he was back working in Las Vegas, introducing Joe Calzaghe and Bernard Hopkins to the ring.</p><p>Michael Buffer has beaten cancer and beaten down any critics who may have thought a car salesman would never make a big time.</p><p>But recently we don’t have any news regarding his illness or any problem behind what actually has happened to him doesn’t seem to get unveiled.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-michael-buffer-not-announcing></span>Why Is Michael Buffer Not Announcing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Buffer is not announcing these days because he will be spending more time overseas.</p><p>The exclusivity of his contract with WCW prevented Buffer from announcing for other wrestling-type organizations, forcing him to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>stop announcing for the UFC.</p><p>But now may be due to his old age and haven’t got much stamina like before he has somehow taken a break from announcing and took a break. However, he has not revealed the reason behind it.</p><p>And as per the news he only announces as pay per view or maybe he is seeking high paying one.</p><p>Buffer is famous for his catchphrase “<strong>Let’s get ready to rumble</strong>!”He has trademarked this phrase and sued numerous people and companies, such as Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema, and Oliver North for using it without his authorization.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-michael-buffer-retired></span>Is Michael Buffer Retired?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Buffer admitted that he is getting close to his retirement last year and relate he may even sell his famous catchphrase.</p><p>Back in 1992, Buffer snagged a trademark for the phrase “let’s get ready to rumble.” Hence, the seasoned announcer is considering selling it for his retirement.</p><p>We may not see him as an announcer much in the upcoming days, as we can already notice, so it might be true that he has already retired.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buffer has not revealed what he would be doing after his retirement or confirmed the reason for absence to the media as of now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-michael-buffer-now></span>Where Is Michael Buffer Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Recently, Michael seems to be engaging in his work as his passion has not overcome his capability.</p><p>Furthermore, his enthusiasm for the work he is doing for many years, kept him occupied with the profession up until now.</p><p>Buffer currently resides in<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Southern California.
