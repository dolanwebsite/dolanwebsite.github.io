Laura is the current financial advisor of the Ottawa Senators, an ice hockey team that competes in the NHL.</p><p>Eugene Melnyk and Laura Melnyk had their wedding in October 1994. Eugene Melnyk celebrated their ninth anniversary by going to an Eagles game.</p><p>After sixteen years of marriage, they divorced in 2010. During their time together, they gave birth to two daughters, Anna and Olivia Melnyk.</p><p>Anna was born on February 10, 1999, and Olivia was born in 2000. They are 23 and 20 years old.</p><p>She has been the financial advisor of the club for quite a while now. She has assisted her daughters, Anna and Olivia, by giving them valuable advice on operating the company. However, recently, the news of Senators being on sale has rocked the headlines; it was obvious for many people as the company’s future was often questioned after the demise of Eugene Melnyk.</p><p>Since the passing of Senators owner Eugene Melnyk, there hasn’t been any public discussion of the team being sold. The franchise is a part of the sizable inheritance he bequeathed to his daughters, Anna and Olivia. It has continued to run normally even after his sudden demise in Mach.</p><p>However, the reports claim that the family has hired New York-based investment bank Galatioto Sports Partners to sell the company. Before deciding what to do next, the Melnyk sisters have been conducting their due diligence and consulting with their mother, Laura, the club’s financial experts, and the independent council.</p><p>Laura has been the internal part of the franchise since its first day of acquisition in 2003. She has acted as a dependable member of the business and assisted in its expansion to new heights.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laura-melnyk-is-the-mother-of-daughters-anna-and-olivia-melnyk></span>Laura Melnyk Is The Mother Of Daughters Anna and Olivia Melnyk<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Laura Melnyk is the caring mother of two daughters, Anna and Olivia Melnyk. Laura gave birth to Anna in 1999, after five years of marriage.</p><p>Anna Melnyk, age 23, and Olivia Melnyk, age 20, are the new owners of Ottawa Senators after their father passed away in March this year.</p><p>Anna is the oldest of two, is currently 23, and has received a Bachelor’s degree in Communications with a Computing Specialization from UCLA. She can run a business successfully and has been doing so since her father’s passing on March 28, 2022.</p><p>However, they have decided to sell the business for a reason they haven’t disclosed yet, and the expected buyers of the company will be finalized soon as every other necessary activity has already been done.</p><p>Likewise, Olivia is 20 as of 2022 and is currently in her third year at Queen’s University. She is majoring in Political Studies. She celebrates her birthday every year on September 3.</p><p>She also plays a vital role in the operation of the Ottawa Senators, but it seems all the financial decisions govern by their mother, Laura, and other members of the club’s board.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-eugene-melnyk-married></span>Was Eugene Melnyk Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eugene Melnyk had married once in the past, to wife Laura Melnyk.</p><p>Eugene married Laura Melnyk on October 8, 1994, and was blessed with two lovely girls from his first marriage, Anna and Olivia Melnyk.</p><p>The former couple shared their marital life for almost 16 years, and during that period, their life was filled with joy and prosperity. However, they signed the divorce papers in 2010 following a personal complication they wished not to share in front of the public.</p><p>At the time of his demise, he was a divorced man who had a relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Sharilyne Anderson.</p><p>Despite the sore past, they maintained a healthy relationship for the sake o their daughters, who were just 11 and 8 during the split. She served as a faithful employee for the Ottawa Senators, an NHL team that Eugene owned, and is still with the company after his demise on March 28, 2022.</p><p>Apart from Laura, Eugene was romantically involved with another lady he had never married. Sharilyne Anderson was his long-time partner whom he dated for several years, and unfortunately, the bond between the two was broken after Eugene left this world. She shared a wonderful life with her boyfriend and was always there by his side during his happy moments and hard times.</p><p>They haven’t explicitly mentioned the date of their first meeting, but the couples are expected to start dating after Eugene and Laura finalized their divorce in 2010.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-eugene-melnyk-first-wife></span>Who is Eugene Melnyk first wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Eugene Melnyk married his first wife, Laura Melnyk, on October 8, 1994.
