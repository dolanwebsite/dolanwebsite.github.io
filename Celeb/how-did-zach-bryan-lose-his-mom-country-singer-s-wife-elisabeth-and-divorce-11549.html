Zac has opened up about the loss of his mother several times with the public and has dedicated his whole life as a tribute to his lovely parent.</p><p>However, the man has not revealed what actually happened to his mom. Thus, we are unaware of the actual circumstances. But the loss was a heavy one for the whole Bryan family as they still remember the wonderful soul they lost too early.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-bryan-wife-is-he-married-to-elisabeth></span>Zach Bryan Wife: Is He Married To Elisabeth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zach Bryan was married to Rose Elizabeth Madden aka Elisabeth.</p><p>Bryan met Madden when he served in the Navy and eventually married her after dating each other for some time, reports&nbsp;Wikipedia. However, the husband and wife relationship didn’t last for long, as the couple divorced after a few years of togetherness.</p><p>The singer titled his second album as Elisabeth. But the music release was not named after his love but instead the meaning of the world Elisabeth, which depicts God’s Promise.</p><p>Currently, Zach Bryan is reportedly single. Likewise, he doesn’t have any children from his past relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-zach-bryan-net-worth></span>What Is Zach Bryan Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zach Bryan has an estimated net worth of around $500,000, as approximated by Famousage.</p><p>The primary source of Zach’s revenue is his musical career, when he has been professionally involved for around five years. During this time as a singer, the singer has made spectacular work in the industry, establishing himself as a prominent artist with multiple hit releases.</p><p>Besides music, his previous work with the US Navy also contributes to accumulating his impressive fortune, which we expect to be around a few hundred thousand dollars at the least. Other than that, his musical collaborations and endorsements also generate a decent amount of money.</p><p>Regardless of the speculations, the official verification regarding Bryan’s wealth is still missing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-zach-bryans-age></span>What Is Zach Bryan’s Age?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zach Bryan’s age is 28 years old as he was born on April 2, 1996.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-zach-bryan-serve-in-the-navy></span>Did Zach Bryan Serve In The Navy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yes, singer Zach Bryan served in the Navy for around eight years after joining the force at the age of 17.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-zach-bryans-net-worth></span>What Is Zach Bryan’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zach Bryan’s net worth is estimated to be around $500,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqltcNmsZqbmGKvs8XAp2Slp6Oaeqm10makqKVdmLy2utOrsGarmaO0pr7SZq6inpVisq210pqZnqyYYq6vsIydoK%2Bnopiy</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fCeleb%2fhow-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singer-s-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-11549.html&text=How%20Did%20Zach%20Bryan%20Lose%20His%20Mom%3f%20Country%20Singer%e2%80%99s%20Wife%20Elisabeth%20and%20Divorce&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fCeleb%2fhow-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singer-s-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-11549.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fhow-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singer-s-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-11549.html&title=How%20Did%20Zach%20Bryan%20Lose%20His%20Mom%3f%20Country%20Singer%e2%80%99s%20Wife%20Elisabeth%20and%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fCeleb%2fhow-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singer-s-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-11549.html&title=How%20Did%20Zach%20Bryan%20Lose%20His%20Mom%3f%20Country%20Singer%e2%80%99s%20Wife%20Elisabeth%20and%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fCeleb%2fhow-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singer-s-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-11549.html&title=How%20Did%20Zach%20Bryan%20Lose%20His%20Mom%3f%20Country%20Singer%e2%80%99s%20Wife%20Elisabeth%20and%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fCeleb%2fhow-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singer-s-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-11549.html&description=How%20Did%20Zach%20Bryan%20Lose%20His%20Mom%3f%20Country%20Singer%e2%80%99s%20Wife%20Elisabeth%20and%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Celeb/how-much-money-does-jalil-hutchins-make-latest-jalil-hutchins-net-worth-income-salary-11531.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Jalil Hutchins Make?
