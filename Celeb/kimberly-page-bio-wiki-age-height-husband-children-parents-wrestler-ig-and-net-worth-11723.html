Page won that fight but ended up losing Kimberly in a match to Johnny B. Badd at the WCW World War 3 pay-per-view event in 1995. Badd quickly freed her and she became his valet, simply going by the name of Kimberly.</p><p>Kimberly did not appear on WCW programming again until March 1997’s Uncensored, when she rejoined Page as part of his feud with “Macho Man” Randy Savage, who had interrupted a Gene Okerlund interview with Page. Miss Elizabeth then flashed an NWO-defaced centerfold of Kimberly from the 1997 edition of Playboy’s Nude Celebrities, after which Kimberly herself appeared from backstage having been spray-painted off-screen by the NWO. The segment was also the first public revelation of Page and Kimberly being an actual married couple.</p><p>After the Page/Savage feud ended, Kimberly formed The Nitro Girls in July. They danced during breaks on WCW Monday Nitro to entertain the fans. The Nitro Girls were given their own official website, while she and several members appeared in a non-nude pictorial in the September 1998 issue of Penthouse, and filmed a 1999 pay-per-view.</p><p>In October 1999, Kimberly again accompanied Page to the ring as his valet. On the November 1, 1999, episode of WCW Monday Nitro she departed the Nitro Girls and later took part in a match against David Flair at Mayhem on November 21. In 2000, she turned heel on Page to join Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff’s New Blood stable. She retired from WCW in 2000.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kimberly-page-actress></span><span>Kimberly Page Actress</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After her retirement,&nbsp;Page took acting jobs at the Alliance Theatre, then moved to Los Angeles&nbsp;to pursue acting as a career.
