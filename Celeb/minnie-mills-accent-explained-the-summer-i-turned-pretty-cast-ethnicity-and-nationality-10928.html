She lived in many different cities all over the world including London, Montreal, New York, Washington D.C., and Carmel California.</p><p>Such upbringing gave her a deep appreciation and understanding of different people, cultures, environments, norms, and values. She often describes herself as being different and further admires herself by adding that “different can be beautiful”.</p><p>Many times people can feel uncomfortable and get nervous having encountered things that are foreign, however, that’s not the case for Minnie.
