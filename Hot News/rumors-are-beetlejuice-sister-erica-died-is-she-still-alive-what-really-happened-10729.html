the greatest Wack Packer of all time by Stem in 2015.</p><p>Beetlejuice has played in multiple acting projects and is a known name in the entertainment industry.</p><p>A video of him discussing his sister, Erica’s death is circulating on the media at the moment.</p><p>And the fans are wondering what might have happened to the lady as they are curious to know more about the incident.</p><p

Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beetlejuice’s sister, Erica is dead as revealed by the actor himself in an interview.</p><p>You can see in the above-embedded video where the actor opens up about her sister’s demise.</p><p>When asked about the woman, Beetlejuice says that she died two years ago.</p><p>He is seen a bit emotional and talks about the passing while the interviewer didn’t know about the death.</p><p>She was a lovely woman and was seen in a similar interview previously, which many people are familiar with.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-beetlejuice-sister-die></span>How Did Beetlejuice Sister Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cause of the death of Beetlejuice’s sister is not known to the outsiders.</p><p>In the video, the actor only says about the death of his sister but doesn’t open up about what happened.</p><p>There are no reports about the incident on the internet and nothing about it can be found on other social media sites as well.</p><p>So, it is thought that Beetlejuice’s sister, Erica, passed away due to a natural phenomenon or a possible illness as any foul play would have been a massive headline on the media.</p><p>Nonetheless, the actual happening is still a mystery to the outsiders.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-was-beetlejuice-sister-erica></span>How Old Was Beetlejuice Sister Erica?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beetlejuice’s sister, Erica, was probably around the age of 50-60 years old.</p><p>She was older than the actor since he is the youngest sibling in the family.</p><p>Since Beetlejuice is now 53, we expect that his sister was in her mid to late fifties at the time of her demise.</p><p>Nevertheless, her actual age and birthdate remain unknown as she was never covered by the media on a personal level.</p><p class=postsid
