What Happened To Him?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe Mantegna was stroked by Bell’s Palsy back in 1988 when he was performing the play Speed the Plow. It was considered temporary, but unfortunately, he has been carrying the facial disease.</p><p>However, the 74-year-old actor is doing well and is still serving the entertainment industry. He started his career in 1969 on a stage. Today he is also a director, executive producer, and actor. Despite his illness, he has not let his guard down and has kept entertaining his viewers.</p><figure></figure><p>Additionally, he has earned his name in the industry and has bagged multiple awards. He has made a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In addition, he is co-writer of an award-winning play, Bleacher Bums.</p><p>Nevertheless, he has portrayed his acting skills in Criminal Minds, Baby’s Day Out, The Godfather III, As We See It, etc. According to&nbsp;IMDb, he has appeared in over 200 films and TV shows.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-mantegna-health-update-illness></span>Joe Mantegna Health Update & Illness<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe Mantegna has had an illness of Bell’s Palsy since the late 80s, and his fans are wondering for updates on his health. He got the stroke while he was performing Speed the Plow. It is a facial condition where a sudden weakness is seen in the one side of the face muscles. Thus the face appears to drop.</p><p>Despite that, we believe the actor is doing perfectly fine. There is not any uncertain news that would worry his fans and followers. Additionally, he has recently posted a story on his social media where he has more than half-million followers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-mantegna-wife-is-arlene-vrhel-how-many-children-do-they-have></span>Joe Mantegna Wife Is Arlene Vrhel- How Many Children Do They Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe Mantegna was married to his wife Arlene Vrhel on 3 October 1975. The actor apologized to his partner in 2018 as he was working during their 43rd wedding anniversary. He was in an interview on The Talk during the 300th episode of Criminal Minds.</p><figure></figure><p>Nevertheless, the pair is blessed with two daughters. Mia is their elder daughter born in 1987and is a make-up artist by profession. In comparison, Gia is the youngest one, born in 1990. Her name was Gina, but later after she turned 18, she changed it to Gia. Nevertheless, she also appeared on KCAL-TV with her father to support Autism Awareness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqru8RmpJqmpJq0r62MoZivnV2WerTA0aiinmWknbJurcKtpqtllKSytHnNqKtmq5Waum7AzmaZnmWZo3qou86dZKGdkaHBqXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fdid-joe-mantegna-have-a-stroke-the-actor-does-not-seem-to-be-in-good-health-11315.html&text=Did%20Joe%20Mantegna%20Have%20A%20Stroke%3f%20The%20Actor%20Does%20Not%20Seem%20To%20Be%20In%20Good%20Health&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fHot%2520News%2fdid-joe-mantegna-have-a-stroke-the-actor-does-not-seem-to-be-in-good-health-11315.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fdid-joe-mantegna-have-a-stroke-the-actor-does-not-seem-to-be-in-good-health-11315.html&title=Did%20Joe%20Mantegna%20Have%20A%20Stroke%3f%20The%20Actor%20Does%20Not%20Seem%20To%20Be%20In%20Good%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fdid-joe-mantegna-have-a-stroke-the-actor-does-not-seem-to-be-in-good-health-11315.html&title=Did%20Joe%20Mantegna%20Have%20A%20Stroke%3f%20The%20Actor%20Does%20Not%20Seem%20To%20Be%20In%20Good%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fdid-joe-mantegna-have-a-stroke-the-actor-does-not-seem-to-be-in-good-health-11315.html&title=Did%20Joe%20Mantegna%20Have%20A%20Stroke%3f%20The%20Actor%20Does%20Not%20Seem%20To%20Be%20In%20Good%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fdid-joe-mantegna-have-a-stroke-the-actor-does-not-seem-to-be-in-good-health-11315.html&description=Did%20Joe%20Mantegna%20Have%20A%20Stroke%3f%20The%20Actor%20Does%20Not%20Seem%20To%20Be%20In%20Good%20Health" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Hot%20News/gigi-hancock-who-is-herbie-hancock-s-wife-is-herbie-hancock-still-married-11290.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gigi Hancock: Who is Herbie Hancock’s wife?
