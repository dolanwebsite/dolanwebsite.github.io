He joined WNYT in January 2010. Since that time, Chris has been eager to tell the great sports stories the Capital Region has to offer.</strong><span id=more-248947></span></p><p>He is particularly grateful for the opportunity to tell the story of Michael Mercado, a Capital Region resident and one of the nation’s best blind golfers. Chris is a graduate of the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College.</p><p>In addition to covering Giant’s training camp in the summer of 2010, Chris produced and reported on a series of high school football team profiles called “High School Football Two-A-Days. Chris turned his focus to Saratoga Race Course for a series of feature stories. In his “Summer at Saratoga” series, Chris highlighted a handful of the traditions, like the race for picnic tables on Travers Saturday, which makes the 40 days of racing so special in the Spa City.</p><p>Prior to coming to NewsChannel 13, Chris was a news reporter & anchor at WWNY in Watertown, NY. He had the privilege of covering sitting and former presidents of the United States’ visits to Fort Drum. It houses the 10th Mountain Division, one of the most deployed units of the U.S. Army.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-wnyt></span>Chris Onorato WNYT<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The WNYT sports reporter and the weekend anchor are joining “Big Board Sports” on ESPN Radio 104.5 The Team (WTTM-FM) as a producer and co-host starting March 23. Onorato replaces Zach Bye, the Scotia-Glenville High School and College of Saint Rose graduate who is moving to Denver to host a sports talk show.</p><p>Bye’s last day is Thursday. Onorato joins his boss, WNYT sports director Rodger Wyland, on the radio show, which moved over from FOX Sports 980 (WOFX-AM) last summer. Chris has filled in for Wyland on the radio show on several occasions at WTMM and WOFX.</p><p>Onorato believes the chemistry between the two is already there. By taking on the radio job, Onorato will be working seven days a week. It will be a busy schedule. Onorato will not be part of WTMM’s broadcasts of the University at Albany football and men’s basketball teams, something Bye did with Wyland. Wyland said there is no rush to hire a new partner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-age-how-old-is-chris-onorato></span>Chris Onorato Age | How Old is Chris Onorato?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris was born on 16th May 1982 in New York, <strong>United States</strong>. He is 37 years old. Onorato&nbsp;currently resides in Ballston Spa in Saratoga Springs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-sachem></span>Chris Onorato Sachem<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris Onorato played soccer his entire life, but when he was cut from the varsity program at Sachem as a junior his athletic career took an interesting turn. Already tall and strong, he was built for the gridiron, so he didn’t think twice when Fred Fusaro came calling. At first, Onorato said he was fed up with the aspect of kicking and liked the idea of throwing his weight around as a tight end.</p><p>Fusaro worked his magic and eventually had Onorato kicking. Onorato was 4-for-7 in field goal attempts at Sachem during his senior year in 1999. He nailed a 48-yard attempt, which still stands as the program record and one of the longest field goals in county history. As a senior, he was named All-Long Island, All-County and All-Division and also averaged 46 yards per punt.</p><p>His best kicking attribute was kickoffs, where he had a 92 percent rate for touchbacks and sent six balls through the uprights in 1999. Programs like Clemson, Wake Forest, Rutgers, and Virginia Tech came calling, but Onorato wanted to say close to Long Island and opted for Division I-AA Hofstra.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-and-ashley-miller-chris-onorato-married-engaged-chris-onorato-wife></span>Chris Onorato and Ashley Miller | Chris Onorato Married | Engaged | Chris Onorato Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>WNYT sports reporters Ashley Miller and Chris Onorato got engaged earlier this week in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a match made in the studio. The couple, who have been dating since late 2013, were on a multi-day vacation in the city known for its history and music when Onorato presented Miller with a ring he helped design.</p><p>Onorato, an Ithaca College graduate, worked with fellow IC alum Kimberly Adams Russell on the halo-cut diamond engagement ring. Russell is part of the team at Frank Adams Jewelers in Stuyvesant Plaza. The couple has not set a date. Their work schedules, says Onorato, will play a role in the date and time of year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-family></span>Chris Onorato Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Onorato is the son of a former nun. “My dad would have you believe his looks and charm pulled my mom away from the convent. Mom would tell Dad to go to penance for telling that lie.” Other than a couple of second cousins, Chris and his brother are the only two redheads in their entire extended family. On the day of the Boston Marathon bombings, Chris was in Boston visiting a friend. He says what he saw in the aftermath near the finish line, he hopes to never see again.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-net-worth></span>Chris Onorato Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Onorato’s net worth hovers over $100,000 to $249,999.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-breast-cancer-research></span>Chris Onorato Breast Cancer Research<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On 29th October people campaign wearing pink to raise funds for breast cancer research. Chris Onorato is one of them. He assisted in scooping vodka relish for the lunch shift at Bellini’s Counter at Stuyvesant Plaza. Onorato also helped the dinner shift.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-facebook></span>Chris Onorato Facebook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-onorato-twitter></span>Chris Onorato Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by chrisonorato</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0ec6npquZpKR6o7XOZpignV2su7rAjKyYnKCVonqiv8elnLJlnZ65rbHRZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fchris-onorato-bio-age-wnyt-sachem-ashley-miller-net-worth-12269.html&text=Chris%20Onorato%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20WNYT%2c%20Sachem%2c%20Ashley%20Miller%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fHot%2520News%2fchris-onorato-bio-age-wnyt-sachem-ashley-miller-net-worth-12269.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fchris-onorato-bio-age-wnyt-sachem-ashley-miller-net-worth-12269.html&title=Chris%20Onorato%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20WNYT%2c%20Sachem%2c%20Ashley%20Miller%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fchris-onorato-bio-age-wnyt-sachem-ashley-miller-net-worth-12269.html&title=Chris%20Onorato%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20WNYT%2c%20Sachem%2c%20Ashley%20Miller%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fchris-onorato-bio-age-wnyt-sachem-ashley-miller-net-worth-12269.html&title=Chris%20Onorato%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20WNYT%2c%20Sachem%2c%20Ashley%20Miller%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fchris-onorato-bio-age-wnyt-sachem-ashley-miller-net-worth-12269.html&description=Chris%20Onorato%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20WNYT%2c%20Sachem%2c%20Ashley%20Miller%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Hot%20News/claudia-martin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-12268.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Claudia Martin.
