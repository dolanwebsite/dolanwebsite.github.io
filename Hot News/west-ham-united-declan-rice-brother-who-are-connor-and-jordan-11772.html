But they also love him very much, and they supported him, right from a young age. Similarly, football has been a tradition for him and his family for a long time, and both his brothers are skillful players playing for the local teams.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, he always wanted to play with his big brothers, right from his childhood, who used to let him play with them sometimes, but he was much younger than them. Despite that fact, he was really competitive, which made his brothers believe that he would get into the professional team in a few years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he gave his best in every game and was able to get into one of the successful teams, and his brothers must be very proud of his achievements.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=do-the-brothers-of-declan-rice-have-an-age-gap-between-them><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-the-brothers-of-declan-rice-have-an-age-gap-between-them></span>Do The Brothers Of Declan Rice Have An Age Gap Between Them?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We do not have any information about the age of the brothers of Declan Rice, but they might have a 3- 4 years of age gap between them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It is hard to find whether Jordan is an elder or Conner due to the lack of information, but they do not have many years of gap in their age. They grew up in Kingston upon Thames, and after a few years, they had begun playing for the local teams at the junior level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, although they have a few years of gap in theri age, their love for each other must have been intact even now, and the sibling bond between the three brothers must be really commendable.
