He inherited his family’s $23 million wealth from the aerospace and automotive industries.</p><p>Coffin died from a gunshot wound to the head, according to the medical examiner. As detectives worked the scene, another fire was reported just over a mile distant.</p><p>The firefighters and homeowner Scott Davis were able to put out the little house fire.

Davis claimed he shot six times at that point.</p><p>When detectives asked if he knew about Coffin’s shooting, Davis replied he’d heard about it from Megan or another mutual friend.</p><p>Police discovered five shotgun shells at Davis’ residence, but no shell casings to back up his story of being shot at.
