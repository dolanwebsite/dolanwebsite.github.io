She was lucky to capture the attention of retired producer and director Martin Beck who proceeded to train the upcoming talent with weekly lessons. When she was 12, Molly Quinn auditioned at the Young Actors Studio, displaying her natural prowess for the scrutiny of veterans like director Linda Seto and some Osbrink Talent Agency reps; the young actress intensified her training after impressing them. Afterward, Osbrink Talent Agency signed her but Molly later moved to Management 360.</p><p>Her first acting role came on the set of Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story – an American Comic movie where she was offered a brief role in 2007. Following this, she had cameo appearances in Disney’s A Christmas Carol, My One and Only as well as The Sacrifice.</p><p>Her first major project came from Beacon Pictures and ABC Studios that signed her on to portray the character of Alexis Castle in Castle – an American crime-comic-drama TV series. Molly Quinn was quick to make good use of the platform in showcasing her talent which gave her a leeway into several roles on both the big screen and small screen. The year 2011 saw her on the set of Nickelodeon’s adaptation of the animated television series Winx Club, she acted as the character of Princess Bloom, while the show lasted till 2014. Meanwhile, Molly lent her voice to the same character in a couple of movie versions of the series.</p><p>From 2011 to 2017, Molly Quinn recorded appearances in productions like We’re the Millers, The First Time, Welcome to Happiness, Hansel & Gretel Get Baked, as well as the Last Rampage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-she-married></span><strong>Is She Married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Molly Quinn is yet to give up the single life in favor of matrimony; however, she is in a relationship with TV producer Elan Gale.
