Troy Scribner is a Greek and Roman history enthusiast.</p><p>At age 13, the actor was cast as Andre Johnson, Jr. opposite Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross in the Emmy and Golden Globe-nominated comedy series Black-ish on ABC.</p><p>Since its debut in September 2014, the series has received praise from critics and accolades, including a coveted Peabody Award in 2015.</p><p>As a member of the ensemble cast, Scribner has also received nominations for several Emmy, Golden Globe, Critics’ Choice, NAACP Image, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p><p>He won two NAACP Image Awards, one in 2016 for Outstanding Performance by a Youth and another in 2019 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Marcus Scribner Is The Only Son Of Troy Scribner and Angela Scribner">Marcus Scribner Is The Only Son Of Troy Scribner and Angela Scribner</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Troy Scribner">Troy Scribner</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Who Is Marcus Scribner Sister?">Who Is Marcus Scribner Sister?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marcus-scribner-is-the-only-son-of-troy-scribner-and-angela-scribner></span>Marcus Scribner Is The Only Son Of Troy Scribner and Angela Scribner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marcus Scribner parents Troy Scribner and Angela Scribner are of biracial ethnicity. Troy Scribner became a parent for the third time on December 2022.</p><p>The talented actor is also bi-racial similar to the character he plays on Black-ish. He was born and raised in Los Angeles, United States by his mom and dad and holds American nationality.</p><p>While his maternal grandmother is from England, his father’s family is from Los Angeles. Marcus’s family has always been very supportive of his hobbies and his career choices. The actor’s family would often drive him to his acting classes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=troy-scribner></span>Troy Scribner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Troy often posts pictures to his&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;account supporting his son. He posts several pictures of his family on his social media account and is often seen attending different events to show his love and appreciation for Marcus.</p><p>He often posts pictures of his wife and his children on his Instagram. Judging from his Instagram account, he also appears to be into cars and seems to be a loving family man. However, his wife does not appear to have her own Instagram account.</p><p>Judging from the social media and Marcus’s lifestyle, he appears to have a very loving and supportive mom and dad. Considering all the love and support he received growing up, it is evident that it had a lot to do with shaping his career and becoming who he is today.</p><p>On May 9 of 2022, Troy posted a picture of his beautiful wife Angela to his&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;account wishing her a happy birthday along with a heartfelt message. He also took the time out of his day to wish every mother a happy mothers day while wishing his beloved partner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-marcus-scribner-sister></span>Who Is Marcus Scribner Sister?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marcus Scribner sister Athena Scribner is 19 years old girl who graduated from her school in June of 2021. Troy and Marcus often post pictures of Athena to their Instagram account.</p><p>Troy took to his Instagram to congratulate his beautiful daughter for graduating on May 2021. He explained how proud he is of his daughter for finishing a milestone in her life and how much he loves her.</p><p>Athena has an Instagram account where she has a single post. This clearly indicates that the young lady is not active on the platform.</p><p>Marcus and Athena seem pretty close, and Athena often supports her brother at different events. Marcus also posts several pictures with his sibling from time to time.</p><p>He posted a series of pictures with Athen to his&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;account in April 2020 wishing her a happy siblings’ day. He published several photos from their childhood and showed appreciation toward his sibling.</p><p>It looks like the siblings are close to one another and very supportive in their own way. While Marcus is an actor, Athena does not seem interested in acting just yet.</p><p>But considering she has recently graduated, she might as well step into the same industry as her brother, Marcus. She was also raised with Marcus in Los Angeles and held an American nationality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRp7C2v4ysmquhkqOys3nFmqSipKliuaqyxGauoqyYYr2ivsSnq6xlkaOxbq3NnWSapl2WsbC%2BwJujnmWjnsC1sdFmaWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fmarcus-scribner-family-life-with-parents-and-and-an-adorable-sister-11406.html&text=Marcus%20Scribner%20Family%20Life%20With%20Parents%20and%20And%20An%20Adorable%20Sister&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fHot%2520News%2fmarcus-scribner-family-life-with-parents-and-and-an-adorable-sister-11406.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fmarcus-scribner-family-life-with-parents-and-and-an-adorable-sister-11406.html&title=Marcus%20Scribner%20Family%20Life%20With%20Parents%20and%20And%20An%20Adorable%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fmarcus-scribner-family-life-with-parents-and-and-an-adorable-sister-11406.html&title=Marcus%20Scribner%20Family%20Life%20With%20Parents%20and%20And%20An%20Adorable%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fmarcus-scribner-family-life-with-parents-and-and-an-adorable-sister-11406.html&title=Marcus%20Scribner%20Family%20Life%20With%20Parents%20and%20And%20An%20Adorable%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fHot%2520News%2fmarcus-scribner-family-life-with-parents-and-and-an-adorable-sister-11406.html&description=Marcus%20Scribner%20Family%20Life%20With%20Parents%20and%20And%20An%20Adorable%20Sister" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/Celeb/meet-bob-goff-wife-maria-goff-their-family-names-revealed-11444.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Bob Goff Wife Maria Goff, Their Family Names Revealed">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/Celeb/lunathi-mampofu-biography-age-career-net-worth-11442.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lunathi Mampofu – Biography, Age, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
