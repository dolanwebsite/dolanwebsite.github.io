She served as the co-host of The Ramsey Show.</p><p>She joined Ramsey Solutions as a speaker, author, college finance expert, and co-host of The Ramsey Show in October 2021. She worked for the company for nearly two years.</p><p>People first speculated Ellis left the show when they saw Dave Ramsey’s Twitter post saying follow my team which did not include her.</p><p>The author was previously on Ramsey’s follow my team and later she was taken off from both the smart conference and building wealth tour that Ellis was supposed to be on.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Not to mention, her Twitter and Instagram bio no more have her down as a Ramsey personality. Reportedly, her departure from The Ramsey Show was internally announced.</p><p>The topic has further sparked discussions on social platforms, including Reddit. “Kristina Ellis&nbsp;has officially left Ramsey!” one Individual started a Reddit discussion a month ago.</p><p>“She was too nice to be working at Ramsey,” another fan added. Another confirmed, “She hasn’t been on since March 9th plus an insider said that it was announced internally that she left.”</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>A separate individual commended her amazing voice for radio and said, “None of the Ramsey personalities are very good because Dave won’t give them wings.”</p><p>Fans have also shown their concern about her absence from the show in her recent Instagram posts. “I feel like we need to know why you left Ramsey,” commented one fan on her April 27 post.</p><p>Within a very short time, Ellis managed to win the hearts of thousands of viewers, and fans are, for sure, very sad learning she quit the show.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kristina-is-married-to-a-former-police-officer></span>Kristina Is Married To A Former Police Officer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kristina Ellis husband Slate is a former police officer. The blissful couple have been together for more than fifteen years.</p><p>In December 2021, Slate retired from his police work nearly after 17 years of service with the&nbsp;Metro Nashville Police Department. He left the role to be a full-time dad for his two kids.</p><p>“I am absolutely, wildly beyond grateful he is willing to take on, and that is the role of a FULL-TIME DAD!!” Ellis wrote on Instagram.</p><p>Writing more, the author shared her husband has served as a Crisis Negotiator, Detective, Peer Supporter, Field Training Officer, and in various other significant roles and initiatives.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>He’s been shot at multiple times, been in countless chases with armed felons, and done undercover cases.</p><p>“He has seen both the best and the worst of humanity, and I will forever be so proud of the work he’s done to serve this city and its people,” Ellis added.</p><p>When Ellis first met Slate, he was working for the police making a government working salary. Nothing was fancy or flashy, but they quickly wanted to spend every evening together.</p><p>Soon, they started dating in 2007. August 2020 marked the pair’s 13th dating anniversary, which they celebrated in Michigan. They spent a night at the most magical “glamping” spot and swam at the lake.</p><p>After dating for four years, the pair finally decided to walk down the aisle on February 19, 2011. They recently celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary with their two little nuggets.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>The pair welcomed their first child, son Jaxon, on August 12, 2018, just the day after Ellis’s birthday. He was 7 pounds 10 ounces and 21 inches as a newborn baby.</p><p>The youngest addition to the family, daughter Kaia, arrived on January 11, 2021. Her name’s meaning is “ray of light” and it perfectly fits her.</p><p>On her first birthday, Ellis said Kaia had been the easiest and happiest baby. She smiles all the time and rarely cries. If Jaxon pushes her or takes her toy, she sasses up a storm of baby talks to give her opinion.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kristina-ellis-career-at-ramsey-solutions></span>Kristina Ellis Career At Ramsey Solutions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kristina served as a finance expert, author, Ramsey Personality, and co-host of The Ramsey Show at Ramsey Solutions.</p><p>Ramsey Solutions is a financial consultant in Franklin, Tennessee, helping people build wealth, create real relationships in a commonsense but countercultural way, and do work they love.</p><p>New York Times best-selling author Dave Ramsey launched the company in 1992 as a measure to provide financial counseling and education.
