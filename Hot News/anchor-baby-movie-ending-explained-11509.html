When she reaches to her attorney, he washes his hand out of it saying he can’t do anything.</p><p>But he gives an idea of Susan taking her baby back to Nigeria while she surrenders to the immigration office. Plus the attorney assures to talk to the immigration officer.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>While Joyce, her baby, and Sarah come to the airport, Joyce goes to surrender to the immigration. When she surrenders, Joyce is handcuffed.</p><p>But when she asks when she will be sent to Nigeria, the officer there says that there is no name booked for her return back to Nigeria that day.</p><p>She says that the immigration officer should know about her but that person had passed in an operation a month ago and she doesn’t even her attorney’s name properly.</p><p>She is taken into custody and she tries to call Susan, but she responds without knowing about it and cuts the call. She tries to call again, but Susan has changed the number.</p><p>Revealed by the truth that she has been manipulated and her baby taken away, she is shocked not knowing what to do.</p><p>Steve comes out of a taxi.

The rest will depend upon the director Lonzo Nzekwe.</p><p>The movie ends with Joyce having to return to her country Nigeria. Meanwhile, her baby was abducted by Susan and her attorney John but she can’t prove that the baby was hers with the legal documents as all the child documentation is based on Susan’s.</p><p>Even if she can prove that she is the child’s mother, she can’t step back into America as she has been deported from the States and is prohibited to return.</p><p>There is almost no option for her to do anything but reminisce about her baby.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Due to such factors, the movie’s second part is almost impossible to create as the movie will have to be created on a factual basis.
